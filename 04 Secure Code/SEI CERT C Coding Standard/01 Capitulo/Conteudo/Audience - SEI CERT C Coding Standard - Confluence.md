The CERT C Secure Coding Standard is primarily intended for developers of C language programs but may also be used by software acquirers to define the requirements for software.Â  The standard is of particular interest to developers who are building high-quality systems that are reliable, robust, and resistant to attack.

While not intended for C++ programmers, the standard may also be of some value to these developers because the vast majority of issues identified for C language programs are also issues in C++ programs, although in many cases the solutions are different.
