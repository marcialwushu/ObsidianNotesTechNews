The development of a coding standard for any programming language is a difficult undertaking that requires significant community involvement. The following development process has been used to create this standard:

1.  Rules and recommendations for a coding standard are solicited from the communities involved in the development and application of each programming language, including the formal or de facto standards bodies responsible for the documented standard.
2.  These rules and recommendations are edited by members of the CERT technical staff for content and style and placed on this wiki for comment and review.
3.  The user community may then comment on the publicly posted content using threaded discussions and other communication tools. Once a consensus develops that the rule or recommendation is appropriate and correct, the final rule is incorporated into an officially released version of the secure coding standard.

Early drafts of the CERT C Secure Coding Standard have been reviewed by theÂ [ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG14](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/) international standardization working group for the C programming language and by other industry groups as appropriate.
