# SysML to AADL with OCL Validation
This presentation by Jason Duran was given virtually at AADL/ACVIP User Day 2022. Increasing the pace of development and digital integrations, requires a tool that can describe many different concepts and components of a system. SysML is one such language that enable many types of information to be represented, however this wide-open expressive power makes if difficult to use for analytical purposes. AADL on the other hand provides this focus and enables the analysis of systems cyber physical properties. This presentation explores what it takes to bridge the gap between these needed tools. Jason Duran is a Systems Engineer at Northrop Grumman. He earned his Doctor of Engineering in Engineering Management from George Washington University, his Master of Science in Software Engineering from Carnegie Mellon and his Bachelors in Computer Science from National University. His principal area of expertise has been enabling system analysis in an MBSE format that cover the whole of the system lifecycle. This include both Software and Hardware in the digital simulation realm as well as the implementation. Jason serves as the technical chair of the Digital Shadow Works MBSE group at Northrop Grumman Mission Systems. Jason spent many years as a software architect prior to switching to systems engineering.
