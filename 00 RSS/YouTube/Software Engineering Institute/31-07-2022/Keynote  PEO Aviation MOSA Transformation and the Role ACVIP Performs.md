# Keynote: PEO Aviation MOSA Transformation and the Role ACVIP Performs
This keynote presentation by Scott Dennis was given virtually at AADL/ACVIP User Day 2022. PEO Aviation (AVN) is undertaking two Transformations: One, executing a Modular Open Systems Approach to procuring, developing, & fielding Open Systems with a consistent Enterprise framework utilizing Model Based Systems Engineering; and Two, implementing Digital Engineering across an Army Aviation Weapon System’s Lifecycle. Utilizing an Architecture Centric Virtual Integration Process (ACVIP) plays a pivotal role in both transformation efforts. PEO AVN is the beneficiary of Army aviation science & technology (S&T) technical risk reduction in the areas of: MOSA, Open Systems Architecture, MBSE, & ACVIP. Scott Dennis currently serves as both the Branch Chief for the Aviation Integration Branch for the U.S. Army’s Development Command Aviation & Missile Center (DEVCOM AvMC) Software, Simulation, Systems Engineering & Integration (S3I) Directorate and the Chief Technical Architect (CTA) for the Army’s Program Executive Office (PEO), Aviation at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama. As the chief for the Aviation Integration Branch, Mr. Dennis leads a team of 108 individuals executing 12 projects (FY21 $22Million) operating 8 system integration laboratories within the domain of avionics, supporting Army manned aviation. As the PEO Aviation CTA, Mr. Dennis establishes the technical vision, provides technical guidance and leads the technical activities to transform PEO Aviation to utilize a Modular Open Systems Approach to specifying, acquiring, developing, fielding, and sustaining Open Systems using Model Based Systems Engineering. Mr. Dennis received a bachelors in electrical engineering in 1992 from Auburn University. He has over 32 years of supporting Army aviation as member of the civilian service.
