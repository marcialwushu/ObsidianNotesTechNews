# Undiscovered Vulnerabilities: Not Just for Critical Software
In this podcast from the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute (SEI), Jonathan Spring, a senior vulnerability researcher, discusses with principal researcher Suzanne Miller the findings in a recent paper analyzing the number of undiscovered vulnerabilities in information systems. Springâ€™s paper examines the paradigm that the number of undiscovered vulnerabilities is manageably small through the lens of mathematical concepts from the theory of computing. #vulnerabilities #software The SEI Podcast Series is available sei.cmu.edu/podcasts and on the following channels: Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series/id566573552?mt=2 Google Podcasts: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VpLmNtdS5lZHUvcG9kY2FzdHMvZmlsZXNfcG9kY2FzdHMvaXR1bmVzRmVlZC54bWw%3D&nord=0 TuneIn: https://tunein.com/podcasts/Technology-Podcasts/SEI-Podcasts-p1217908/ SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/cmu-sei-podcasts Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/1CAKTiVZUTC3BlNOrTc4Zw
