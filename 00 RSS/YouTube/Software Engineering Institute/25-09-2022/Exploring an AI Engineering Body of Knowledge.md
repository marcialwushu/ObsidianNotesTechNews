# Exploring an AI Engineering Body of Knowledge
In this webcast we will discuss maturing artificial intelligence (AI) practices based on our current body of knowledge. Much as it did for software engineering in the 1980s, the SEI has begun formalizing the field of AI engineering, beginning with identifying three fundamental pillars to guide AI engineering: human-centered, scalable, and robust and secure. Join us to learn more about these pillars and how they can be used to help national defense and security agencies adopt and develop AI. Attendees Will Learn About: • Identifying the tenets of AI engineering • Assessing novel AI knowledge areas • Expanding the reach of systems and software engineering Who Should Attend? • Government program managers • Acquisition officers • Military leadership • CTO leadership and equivalent • Engineering management #ai #artificialintelligence #aiengineering @Software Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University
