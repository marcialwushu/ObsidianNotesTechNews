# Using Open Source to Shrink the Cyber Workforce Gap
By all recent measures, the cybersecurity workforce is woefully understaffed. According to (ISC)², the cyber workforce gap in the United States was 377,000 open positions in 2021. The Software Engineering Institute (SEI) at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) has been working with the U.S. government to development novel approaches designed to shrink this gap. This talk will focus on open source initiatives that bring innovative ideas to cybersecurity modeling and simulation, assessment, and competitions What Attendees will Learn: • Understanding of the challenges facing the cyber workforce and how to build engaging content that will help close the workforce gap • Where to find open source projects developed by the Software Engineering Institute to build cyber exercises, training labs and simulations • Hands on experience that can be immediately applied to workforce development initiatives in their own organization #workforcedevelopment #cybersecurity #opensource @Software Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University
