# DevSecOps Days Washington D.C. 2022
DevSecOps Days are back in 2022 with three SEI-hosted free virtual events that give you the opportunity to elevate how you integrate security into your DevOps practices and transform your DevSecOps journey. Learn from fellow practitioner successes, discover ideas on integrating security into your teams, and leave with insights on automating security within the entire developer and production pipeline. Join us from Washington D.C. for the third event in our 2022 series!
