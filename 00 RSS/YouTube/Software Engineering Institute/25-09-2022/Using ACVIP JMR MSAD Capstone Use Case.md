# Using ACVIP JMR MSAD Capstone Use Case
This presentation by Stephanie Burns and Andrew Muxen was given virtually at AADL/ACVIP User Day 2022. Collins use of Architecture Analysis Design Language (AADL)-based architecture analyses during Joint Multi-Role Mission System Architecture Definition (JMR MSAD) Capstone provided us an opportunity to analyze the implementation before we integrated reusable software components. Our brief provides an overview of our JMR MSAD Capstone effort, the Architecture Centric Virtual Integration Process (ACVIP) tools used, and how AADL analysis facilitated integration. We have since incorporated those lessons learned into our future digital engineering initiatives. Stephanie Burns is a Technical Fellow with Collins Aerospace. She has been involved in several Army Science and Technology programs associated with Joint Multi-Role Mission System Architecture Definition (JMR MSAD) defining requirements for open systems approaches and served as Principal Investigator on DARPA Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) TA6 applying AADL and AGREE to demonstrate a cyber hardened system. Andrew Muxen is a principal systems engineer with Collins Aerospace. He has been involved in the Capstone, A-TEAM, and FVL programs. He also leads adoption of MBSE at Collins through the Collins MBSE WG and is OCSMP Model Builder-Intermediate certified.
