# DevSecOps Engineers
We are Hiring! DevOps Engineers See: https://cmu.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/SEI/details/Associate-DevOps-Engineer_2018652-1 DevOps – shorthand for development and operations – fosters process and organizational practice improvements to speed up the delivery of high-quality software. The Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) Software Engineering Institute (SEI) is a leader in the DevOps community through its work to advance DevSecOps, which augments DevOps to automate the integration of security at every phase of the software development lifecycle. The SEI became the first federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) to work on implementing DevSecOps practices at the DoD; launched the first course in the world on DevSecOps in the graduate program in the CMU School of Computer Science; and regularly delivers keynotes at conferences and events, including DevSecOps days. In this episode, Matt Butkovic interviewed Hasan Yasar, technical director for continuous deployment of capability, about two job openings on his team for DevOps engineers with solid Linux knowledge and experience. Yasar’s team conducts the research, development, and transition of DevSecOps engineering solutions and Agile methods for software acquisition. Butkovic and Yasar will discuss the SEI’s openings for a senior DevOps engineer and a DevOps engineer, both to be based in Boulder, CO (USA), assisting SEI customers. Successful candidates for these positions will be involved in key decisions regarding software design and technology selection, including hands-on development activities. As employees of CMU, successful candidates will enjoy an eight percent monthly contribution for retirement; tuition benefits to CMU for you and your dependent children; assistance with childcare costs; and relocation assistance, among other benefits. #devsecops #devops #softwaredeveloper #hiring
