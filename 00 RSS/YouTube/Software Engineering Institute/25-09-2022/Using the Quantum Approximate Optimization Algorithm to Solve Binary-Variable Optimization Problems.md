# Using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to Solve Binary-Variable Optimization Problems
In this podcast from the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute, Jason Larkin and Daniel Justice, researchers in the SEIâ€™s AI Division, discuss a paper outlining their efforts to simulate the performance of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for the Max-Cut problem and compare it with some of the best classical alternatives, for exact, approximate, and heuristic solutions. #quantumcomputing The SEI Podcast Series is available sei.cmu.edu/podcasts and on the following channels: Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series/id566573552?mt=2 Google Podcasts: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VpLmNtdS5lZHUvcG9kY2FzdHMvZmlsZXNfcG9kY2FzdHMvaXR1bmVzRmVlZC54bWw%3D&nord=0 TuneIn: https://tunein.com/podcasts/Technology-Podcasts/SEI-Podcasts-p1217908/ SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/cmu-sei-podcasts Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/1CAKTiVZUTC3BlNOrTc4Zw
