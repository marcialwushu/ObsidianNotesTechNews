# Software Architecture Patterns for Robustness
In this podcast from the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute, visiting scientist Rick Kazman and principal researcher Suzanne Miller discuss software architecture patterns and the effect that certain architectural patterns have on quality attributes, such as availability and robustness. Kazman also provides examples of mechanisms—such as architectural tactics and patterns—and the effects they have on availability and robustness, especially in cloud-based systems. #software #softwarearchitecture #patterns #robustness The SEI Podcast Series is available sei.cmu.edu/podcasts and on the following channels: Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series/id566573552?mt=2 Google Podcasts: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VpLmNtdS5lZHUvcG9kY2FzdHMvZmlsZXNfcG9kY2FzdHMvaXR1bmVzRmVlZC54bWw%3D&nord=0 TuneIn: https://tunein.com/podcasts/Technology-Podcasts/SEI-Podcasts-p1217908/ SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/cmu-sei-podcasts Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/1CAKTiVZUTC3BlNOrTc4Zw
