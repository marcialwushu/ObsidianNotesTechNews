# Ransomware: Defense and Resilience Strategies
Ransomware poses an imminent threat to most organizations. Whereas most traditional cyber attacks require extended threat actor engagement to seeking out critical information, exporting data, and demanding ransom from victims, ransomware shortens the process and puts immediate pressure on the victim to respond with payment. Unfortunately, the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and other novel attack techniques have made these attacks more ubiquitous as they are pernicious. In this talk, Brett Tucker will discuss a novel means for assessing an organization to determine its susceptibility to ransomware and explore the organization’s resilience to recover normal operations after a successful attack. Attendees will learn about the key domains for analysis and practical tips for facilitating resilience assessments. What Attendees will Learn: • Key features and domains covered in a ransomware susceptibility assessment • Potential pitfalls and challenges when assessing your organization’s vulnerabilities to ransomware #ransomware #cyberresilience #cybersecurity @Software Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University
