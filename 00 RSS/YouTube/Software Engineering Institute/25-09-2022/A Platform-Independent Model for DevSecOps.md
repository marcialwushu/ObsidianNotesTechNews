# A Platform-Independent Model for DevSecOps
DevSecOps encompasses all the best software engineering principles known today with an emphasis on faster delivery through increased collaboration of all stakeholders resulting in more secure, useable, and higher-quality software systems. In this podcast from the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute, researchers Tim Chick and Joe Yankel discuss the DevSecOps Platform-Independent Model (PIM), which uses model based systems engineering (MBSE) to formalize the practices of DevSecOps pipelines and organize relevant guidance. This first-of-its-kind model gives software development enterprises the structure and articulation needed for creating, maintaining, securing, and improving DevSecOps pipelines #DevSecOps, #MBSE, #model-based systems engineering The SEI Podcast Series is available sei.cmu.edu/podcasts and on the following channels: Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series/id566573552?mt=2 Google Podcasts: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VpLmNtdS5lZHUvcG9kY2FzdHMvZmlsZXNfcG9kY2FzdHMvaXR1bmVzRmVlZC54bWw%3D&nord=0 TuneIn: https://tunein.com/podcasts/Technology-Podcasts/SEI-Podcasts-p1217908/ SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/cmu-sei-podcasts Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/1CAKTiVZUTC3BlNOrTc4Zw
