# A Roadmap for Creating and Using Virtual Prototyping Software
In this podcast from the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute, Douglass Post and Richard Kendall, authors of Creating and Using Virtual Prototyping Software: Principles, and Practices, discuss with principal researcher Suzanne Miller experiences and insights that they gleaned from applying virtual prototyping in CREATE (Computational Research and Engineering Acquisition Tools and Environments), a multiyear DoD program to develop and deploy software for systems like ships, air vehicles, ground vehicles, and radio-frequency antennas. CREATE enabled engineers and scientists to design these complex systems and to accurately predict their performance. #software, #virtual, #prototyping The SEI Podcast Series is available sei.cmu.edu/podcasts and on the following channels: Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series/id566573552?mt=2 Google Podcasts: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VpLmNtdS5lZHUvcG9kY2FzdHMvZmlsZXNfcG9kY2FzdHMvaXR1bmVzRmVlZC54bWw%3D&nord=0 TuneIn: https://tunein.com/podcasts/Technology-Podcasts/SEI-Podcasts-p1217908/ SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/cmu-sei-podcasts Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/1CAKTiVZUTC3BlNOrTc4Zw
