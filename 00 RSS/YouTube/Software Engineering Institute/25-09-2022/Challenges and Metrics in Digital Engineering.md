# Challenges and Metrics in Digital Engineering
Digital engineering uses digital tools and representations in the process of developing, sustaining, and maintaining systems, including requirements, design, analysis, implementation, and test. The digital modeling approach is intended to establish an authoritative source of truth for the system, in which discipline-specific views of the system are created using the same model elements. In this podcast from the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute (SEI), William “Bill” Nichols, a senior member of the technical staff with the SEI’s Software Solutions Division, discusses with principal researcher Suzanne Miller the challenges in making the transition from traditional development practices to digital engineering. #digitalengineering The SEI Podcast Series is available sei.cmu.edu/podcasts and on the following channels: Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series/id566573552?mt=2 Google Podcasts: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VpLmNtdS5lZHUvcG9kY2FzdHMvZmlsZXNfcG9kY2FzdHMvaXR1bmVzRmVlZC54bWw%3D&nord=0 TuneIn: https://tunein.com/podcasts/Technology-Podcasts/SEI-Podcasts-p1217908/ SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/cmu-sei-podcasts Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/1CAKTiVZUTC3BlNOrTc4Zw
