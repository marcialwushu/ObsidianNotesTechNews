# AI Engineering with DevSecOps
AI engineering is an emergent discipline focused on developing tools, systems, and processes to enable the application of artificial intelligence in real-world contexts. DevSecOps is a set of principles and practices that provide faster delivery of secure software capabilities. It improves the collaboration and communication between software development teams, IT operations, and security staff within an organization, as well as with acquirers, suppliers, and other stakeholders in the lifecycle of a software system. In this podcast from the Carnegie Mellon University Software Engineering Institute (SEI), Hasan Yasar, technical director of Continuous Deployment of Capability at the SEI, and Jay Palat, interim director of AI for Mission in the SEIâ€™s AI Division, discuss how to engineer AI systems with DevSecOps and explore the relationship between MLOps and DevSecOps. #AI #DevSecOps #Engineering The SEI Podcast Series is available sei.cmu.edu/podcasts and on the following channels: Apple Podcasts: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series/id566573552?mt=2 Google Podcasts: https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2VpLmNtdS5lZHUvcG9kY2FzdHMvZmlsZXNfcG9kY2FzdHMvaXR1bmVzRmVlZC54bWw%3D&nord=0 TuneIn: https://tunein.com/podcasts/Technology-Podcasts/SEI-Podcasts-p1217908/ SoundCloud: https://soundcloud.com/cmu-sei-podcasts Stitcher: https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/software-engineering-institute-sei-podcast-series Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/1CAKTiVZUTC3BlNOrTc4Zw
