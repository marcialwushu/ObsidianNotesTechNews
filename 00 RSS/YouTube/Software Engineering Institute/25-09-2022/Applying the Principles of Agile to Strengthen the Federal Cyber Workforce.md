# Applying the Principles of Agile to Strengthen the Federal Cyber Workforce
The lack of qualified cybersecurity professionals in the United States is a threat to our national security. We cannot adequately protect the systems that our government, economy, and critical infrastructure sectors rely on without an appropriately sized cyber workforce. By some estimates, there are over 700,000 cybersecurity job openings across the United States, with 39,000 of those in the public sector alone. Fortunately, the federal government recognizes that the cyber workforce needs to be strengthened and is implementing efforts to address this need at a national strategic level. In this webcast, we will examine how to use principles and concepts from Agile development to help cyber workforce development initiatives remain adaptable and effective in the continuously evolving landscape of the cyber domain. Attendees Will Learn About: • Issues that are contributing to the cybersecurity workforce shortage • Current initiatives that are trying to address these issues • How to use concepts from Agile development to address the cybersecurity workforce shortage #cybersecurity #workforcedevelopment @Software Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University
