# Developing Models to Support DoD Technical Reviews
This webcast will discuss guidelines that contractors can use to develop models to support System Engineering Technical Reviews. We based these guidelines on Department of Defense (DOD) Data Item Descriptions (DID) requirements, the stated purpose of System Engineering Technical Review (SETR) events (e.g., SRR, SFR, PDR), and the needs of review participants. What Attendees Will Learn • how a use-case-based approach can help identify the information you need to support System Engineering Technical Reviews • how to map the information you need to support System Engineering Technical Reviews to information types and modeling guidelines • examples of modeling guidelines for modeling the needed information • the benefits of having such guidelines #systemengineering #modeling @Software Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University
