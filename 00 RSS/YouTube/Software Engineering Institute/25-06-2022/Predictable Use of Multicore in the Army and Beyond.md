# Predictable Use of Multicore in the Army and Beyond
Complex, cyber-physical DoD systems, such as aircraft, depend on correct timing to properly and reliably execute crucial sensing, computing, and actuation functions. In this webcast, SEI staff members Bjorn Andersson, PhD, Dionisio de Niz, PhD, and William Vance of the U.S. Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Aviation & Missile Center will discuss using real-time software on multicore processors. Specifically, they will review the challenges that DoD and civilian systems face and the proven solutions that are available. What Attendees Will Learn • Why timing requirements matter • The potential severity of being unaware of resource contention and not addressing it • State-of-the-art tools and techniques to satisfy the real-time requirements of software executing on multicore processors • How the DoD can use (and has used) these tools #multicore #cyberphysical #software @Software Engineering Institute | Carnegie Mellon University
