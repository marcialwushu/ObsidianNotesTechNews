# Reactronica: Music as a Function of State — Kaho Cheung
React treats UI as a function of state. What if React’s declarative programming model could be applied to music as well? Reactronica aims to treat music as a function of state, rendering sound rather than UI (Using ToneJS). Some possibilities of this library will be showcased, including a piano sequencer and ukulele tab editor. Most ambitious is a (very) early prototype of a browser based Digital Audio Workstation. The presentation will go through the inner workings of the library, emphasising its use of Hooks and Context.
