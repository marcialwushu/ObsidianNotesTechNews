# (Proto)typing innovation in BBC News â€” James Dooley
BBC News Labs explore, prototype and incubate new ways to tell stories, reach audiences and create cutting edge journalism. James will demonstrate how his team made transcribing interviews - something journalists spend hours every day doing - faster, easier, and data-rich by creating an interactive, time-encoded text editor with Draft.js. By making it an open-source component library, BBC managed to add this functionality and productivity to many other tools, both in the BBC and outside - empowering other newsrooms to innovate in their own spaces.
