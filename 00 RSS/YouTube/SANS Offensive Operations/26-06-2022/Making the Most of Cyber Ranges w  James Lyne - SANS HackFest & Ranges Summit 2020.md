# Making the Most of Cyber Ranges w/ James Lyne - SANS HackFest & Ranges Summit 2020
The depth and breadth of the security profession continue to expand and provide challenges for individuals and teams alike. Cyber ranges vary in shape, size, and learning outcomes. How do you make the most of ranges as a space to sharpen your skills? What is the right type of range for your level of experience or skill? In this talk, James will explore how ranges may evolve to meet our future adversary simulation needs, and how teams can maximize their outcomes from exercises. James Lyne @jameslyne, SANS Institute
