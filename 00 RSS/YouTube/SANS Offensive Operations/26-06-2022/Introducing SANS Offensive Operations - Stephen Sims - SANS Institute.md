# Introducing SANS Offensive Operations | Stephen Sims | SANS Institute
One of my goals when taking over as curriculum lead of SANS Penetration Testing was to continue to broaden the scope of offensive-related course offerings and to cover every possible attack vector across the entire threat landscape. With over 25 courses in total, spanning topics ranging from introductory penetration testing and hardware hacking, all the way to advanced exploit writing and advanced red teaming, it made sense to identify a name that encompasses all of the underlying offensive-oriented courses and topic areas. Thus, Offensive Operations was born. The courses within the curriculum are now broken up into focus areas including penetration testing, red teaming, purple teaming, and exploit development. In this webcast, Stephen Sims elaborates on these updates and speaks about the 9 exciting new courses we have in development. Speaker Bio Stephen Sims is an industry expert with over 15 years of experience in information technology and security. Stephen currently works out of San Francisco as a consultant.
