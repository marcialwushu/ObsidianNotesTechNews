# Demystifying Capture the Flag (CTF) Competitions | Pen Test HackFest 2021
Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions range in style and difficulty but each and every CTF offers a wealth of knowledge for any participant. In the talk: Demystifying CTFs, Barrett Darnell will provide an overview of CTF formats, the skills they require and the skills they develop, and conclude with a plethora of CTF resources for those wanting to participate. The main focus of the talk will be relating how both technical and non-technical skills learned through CTF participation can be applied to real world information security challenges.
