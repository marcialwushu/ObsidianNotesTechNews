# Getting the Most of Out of Free CtFs w/ Derek Rook - SANS HackFest & Ranges Summit 2020
You’ve probably heard of the DefCon Capture the Flag (CTF) and the annual Holiday Hack Challenge from Counter Hack Challenges. But did you know that there are multiple CTF events happening online almost all the time? This talk will help you figure out where to find them and how to get started. Most importantly, you’ll learn why you should. Derek Rook, who has captured quite a number of flags, will discuss how CTFs have helped him learn and sharpen valuable professional skills, network with industry peers, and make some lifelong friends. Whether you just want to learn or to compete for glory (or both!), Derek will point you towards the right resources. Derek Rook @_r00k_, Senior Manager - Offensive Security, Teradata
