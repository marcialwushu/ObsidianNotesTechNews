# Keynote: Get Offensive with Management | Pen Test HackFest Summit 2021
There are two kinds of companies: those where leadership cares and... those where they don't. No amount of personal heroics, technical awesomesauce, or the world's great tool is going to change that and have the business suddenly get it. So how do we get them to care? We'll talk how to get leadership buy-in for your offsec program, how to translate this for different kinds of offensive assessments (vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, red teaming, and purple teaming), metrics (including real-world data) derived from a detection maturity model I created with business context (alignment). Come with questions and curiosity, leave with actionable insights to build or mature your risk assessment program.
