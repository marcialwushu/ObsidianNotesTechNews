# SANS Workshop - Reflection in C#
Relevant Course: https://www.sans.org/sec699 Presented by: Jean-François Maes https://twitter.com/Jean_Maes_1994 PLEASE NOTE - this video was edited from a live workshop. Pause when starting a lab in the workshop then resume the video once finished. During your infosec career you have probably come across the term “reflection” at one point or another. “reflective dll injection”, “reflective loading”, … In this workshop you will learn how to leverage the power of C# and it’s built in reflection capabilities! You will create a loader with basic functionality then keep expanding upon it for multiple iterations. In the end, you will have learned how to create a full-fledged loader that can fetch and load multiple programs, handle unexpected error 404’s and more! Prerequisites: Having a bit of coding experience is recommended, however, you do not need specific knowledge of C#. We will go step by step and explain each and every step so it is easily understood. Prior to the workshop, please download and install Lab 0. Workshop gitbook https://jfmaes-1.gitbook.io/reflection-workshop/ System Requirements: You will need access to a computer with dotnetframework and visualstudio 2019 installed.
