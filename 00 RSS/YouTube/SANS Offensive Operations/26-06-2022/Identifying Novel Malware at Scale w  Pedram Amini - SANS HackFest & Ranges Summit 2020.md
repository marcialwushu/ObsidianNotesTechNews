# Identifying Novel Malware at Scale w/ Pedram Amini - SANS HackFest & Ranges Summit 2020
It's no secret that client-side attacks are a common source of compromise for many organizations. Web browser and e-mail borne malware campaigns target users by way of phishing, social engineering, and exploitation. Office suites from vendors such as Adobe and Microsoft are ubiquitous and provide a rich and ever-changing attack surface. Poor user awareness and clever social engineering tactics frequently result in users consenting to the execution of malicious embedded logic such as macros, JavaScript, ActionScript, and Java applets. In this talk, we'll explore a mechanism for harvesting a variety of these malware lures for the purposes of dissection and detection. We'll explore mechanisms for clustering and identifying "interesting" samples. Specifically, we're on the hunt for malware lures that can provide a heads up to defenders on upcoming campaigns as adversaries frequently test their lures against AV consensus. Multiple real-world examples are provided, proving that an astute researcher, can harvest zero-day exploits from the public domain. Pedram Amini @pedramamini, CTO, InQuest
