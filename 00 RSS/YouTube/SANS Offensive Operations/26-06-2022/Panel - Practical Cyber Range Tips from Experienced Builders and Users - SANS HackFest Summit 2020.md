Alternatively, they can lead to frustration and wasted time if you don’t plan well. This panel of veteran range builders and participants will share some of their best practical tips on how you and your team can get the most out of your range and CtF experiences. We’ll talk about lessons learned, address pitfalls to avoid, and share some great ideas from these panelists who have decades of experience with some of the best ranges and CtF environments in the industry.
