# Which Came First: The Phish or the Opportunity to Defend Against It
Does a campaign start at Initial Access? Threat intelligence proves otherwise, so as defenders can we avoid giving adversaries a head start? In this talk we will look at emulating adversaries "left-of-exploit". We recently updated MITRE ATT&CKÂ® for Enterprise to include behaviors adversaries use to select a target, obtain information, and launch a campaign previously only found in a separate PRE-ATT&CK matrix. These changes allow us to better connect the ways we think about defending our networks with the behaviors adversaries perform leading up to a compromise. We will discuss how you can incorporate this broader perspective into your assessments. Specifically, we will use real examples from threat intelligence to walk through opportunities to emulate and defend behaviors from the new Reconnaissance and Resource Development tactics of ATT&CK.
