# Overview of SEC661: ARM Exploit Development and an Introduction to Router Emulation
Relevant Course: https://www.sans.org/sec661 Presented by: John deGruyter https://www.sans.org/profiles/john-degruyter/ With the recent explosion of IoT in the consumer market, ARM has quickly taken the world by storm and established itself as the forerunner in embedded technology. With numbers reporting in the billions (that’s billions with a ‘b’), it doesn’t look like things are slowing down anytime soon. In this webcast we will be giving an overview of the new SANS ARM Exploit Development course. As a bonus, there will be a technical segment where we go over how to emulate a Netgear router and discuss some of the pitfalls that come with the hardware emulation.
