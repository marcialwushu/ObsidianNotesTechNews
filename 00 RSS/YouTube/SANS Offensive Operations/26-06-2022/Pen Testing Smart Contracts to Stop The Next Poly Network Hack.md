# Pen Testing Smart Contracts to Stop The Next Poly Network Hack
Related Course: https://www.sans.org/sec555 Presented by: Steven Walbroehl and Stephen Sims https://twitter.com/halbornsteve https://twitter.com/Steph3nSims Discussion of the Poly Network hack and implications to DeFi Security vulnerabilities, auditing, and how to pen test them. For a breakdown of how the hack happened, speaker Steven Walboehl does an extensive code analysis in the Halborn video Biggest Hack In Crypto History Poly Network Hack (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b82SM3t8kxM) that can be viewed prior to this webcast. Recent Events: What happened in the Poly Network Hack? What vulnerabilities allowed them to steal the funds? Does this sort of thing happen often in DeFi? How would you protect something like this from happening again? General Discussion: What makes Blockchain / Smart Contract Security unique from the rest of cyber security? Do you see these vulnerabilities (like the one in Poly Network) when you audit smart contracts? What other kinds of vulnerabilities are there you commonly find in your audits? Career Impact: What is the work like in a Cybersecurity firm focused on Blockchain? Do you see the discipline growing, and the demand increasing for Smart Contract testers? How would one learn how to hack smart contracts?
