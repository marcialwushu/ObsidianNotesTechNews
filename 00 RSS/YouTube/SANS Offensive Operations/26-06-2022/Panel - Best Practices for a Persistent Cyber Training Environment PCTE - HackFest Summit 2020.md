# Panel - Best Practices for a Persistent Cyber Training Environment PCTE - HackFest Summit 2020
Best Practices for a Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) - Panel Discussion Moderator: James Yacone, Chief of Mission, SANS Institute Panelists: Amit Kapadia, Product Manager for Cyber Resiliency and Training (PdM CRT), Chief Engineer, U.S. Army Program Executive Office for Simulation, Training and Instrumentation (PEO STRI) Thomas R. Monaghan Jr., LTC, AR, Product Manager, PdM Cyber Resiliency & Training (CRT) COLONEL Tanya R. Trout, TXARNG The Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) addresses a critical and urgent need to provide a persistent and realistic training environment to Joint Cyber Mission Forces (CMF). To address this, PCTE is leveraging rapid acquisition and prototyping efforts to develop capability efficiently and quickly. PCTE is a cloud-based training platform supporting individual sustainment training, team certification, and provides the foundation for collective training exercises (i.e. Cyber Flag, Cyber Guard). PCTE leverages existing connectivity and is a cloud-based environment to facilitate the sharing of resources (such as scenarios and content), and provide additional cyber "maneuver space" (such as emulated Red, Blue, Gray, and Industrial Control System (ICS) environments). PCTE enables realistic training with variable conditions to increase readiness and lethality of our Cyberspace Forces, while simplifying and automating the training management process. Program Characteristics: Integration: Integrate existing and future cyber training capabilities into the standard PCTE platform. Environment: Integrate Red, Blue, Gray, and Industrial Control System (ICS) environments. Event Management: Software that rapidly facilitates the planning and execution of individual, team, and collective training. Connectivity: Provides compute, storage, and leverages existing transport to enable persistent and available training, assessment, and mission rehearsal capability.
