Affiliated course: https://www.sans.org/sec564 Resource site: https://redteamer.tips Presented by: Jorge Orchilles and Jean-François Maes Follow Jorge: https://twitter.com/jorgeorchilles Follow Jean-François: https://twitter.com/Jean_Maes_1994 Red Teaming is hot right now. Many people want to get into it just because it sounds cool. While I tend to agree, there are many things to consider. There is way more to red teaming than just "getting in" to organizations. Join us for this one hour webcast where we cover what red team is, why you may want to be a red teamer, and how to become a red teamer.
