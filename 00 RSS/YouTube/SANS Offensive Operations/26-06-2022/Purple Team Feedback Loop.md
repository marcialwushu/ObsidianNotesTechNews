# Purple Team Feedback Loop
This talk will break down different ways blue and red teams can work together to make an effective purple team and provide stronger outcomes to the business. It will cover ways to create net-new processes as well as improve an existing process. It will also highlight common pitfalls both with and without a purple team and the roles that the various teams play (detection, threat intel, analyst, threat hunting, penetration testing, and red teams) in an effective purple teaming exercise. All teams need a strong feedback process and/or integrated workflow for success.
