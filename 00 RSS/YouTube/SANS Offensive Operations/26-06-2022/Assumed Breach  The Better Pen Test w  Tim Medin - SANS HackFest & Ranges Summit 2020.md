# Assumed Breach: The Better Pen Test w/ Tim Medin - SANS HackFest & Ranges Summit 2020
Traditional penetration testing often concedes internal access to the tester, but then the tester does a lot of scanning and poking around. This is not representative of most breaches. Most breaches start with a phish and adversary effectively starts with access as one of your users on one of your systems. Are you prepared to defend? In this talk, Tim Medin will discuss the shortcomings of the traditional penetration test, and talk you through ways to deliver (and receive) a higher value penetration test.
