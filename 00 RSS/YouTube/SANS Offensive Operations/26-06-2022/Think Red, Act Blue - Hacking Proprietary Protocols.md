# Think Red, Act Blue - Hacking Proprietary Protocols
Presented by: Ismael Valenzuela, Douglas McKee Follow Ismael here: https://twitter.com/aboutsecurity Follow Douglas here: https://twitter.com/fulmetalpackets Nation-states and threat actors are increasingly targeting industrial networks and critical infrastructure. As part of their attacks, they often conduct extensive reconnaissance to discover vulnerabilities that can give them access and full control over critical systems. Some of these may even have the potential to threaten the safety of citizens and personnel inside targeted facilities. Often we find vendors using proprietary protocols to communicate on our networks. Naturally, these protocols are harder to understand and protect due to a lack of publicly available information. As a result, sophisticated attackers are taking the time to analyze these protocols for vulnerabilities as they too often go unprotected by organizations. In this webinar, Douglas McKee and Ismael Valenzuela, using their combined 30 years of experience in cybersecurity, will walk through how an adversary can dissect and understand proprietary protocols on your network to find vulnerabilities or leak sensitive information. These same techniques can be used by red teamers as well as blue teamers, to emulate behaviors and anticipate the adversary. We will provide insights using real data embedded into proprietary networking protocols used by vendors and the techniques needed to breakdown and understand this information.
