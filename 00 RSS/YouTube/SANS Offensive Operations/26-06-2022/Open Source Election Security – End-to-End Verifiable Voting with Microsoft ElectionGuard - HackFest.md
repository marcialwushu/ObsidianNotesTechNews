# Open Source Election Security – End-to-End Verifiable Voting with Microsoft ElectionGuard - HackFest
Microsoft’s Defending Democracy Program released ElectionGuard as an open-source SDK that makes voting systems more secure, transparent, and accessible. Though not a voting system itself, the ElectionGuard SDK integrates with new and existing technologies to leverage homomorphic encryption to ensure that votes recorded by electronic systems of any type remain encrypted, secure, and secret. Meanwhile, ElectionGuard also allows verifiable and accurate tallying of ballots by any 3rd party watchdog organization without compromising ballot secrecy or security. In this session, we will discuss some background on election security and end-to-end verifiable (E2EV) elections, the fundamentals of ElectionGuard, our associated Bug Bounty and security research program, and why we believe that developing election security technology in the open encourages a more secure and more robust democracy.
