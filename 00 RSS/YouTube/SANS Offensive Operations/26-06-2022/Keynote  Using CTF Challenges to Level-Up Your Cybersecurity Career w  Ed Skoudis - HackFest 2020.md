# Keynote: Using CTF Challenges to Level-Up Your Cybersecurity Career w/ Ed Skoudis - HackFest 2020
Capture-the-Flag (CtF) events are a dynamic, fun, and challenging vehicle for developing hands-on skills. Yet, few people take full advantage of all the great career-boosting results they can get from participating in a CtF. In this keynote talk, Ed Skoudis will share specific strategies and tactics for leveraging CtFs to help you systematically take your career to the next level — building your skills, making yourself more valuable to your organization, and landing that job assignment you’ve always longed for. Additionally, Ed will release the H2 Matrix, a new tool to help you identify and maximize all that you can gain from the CtFs that are best for you. Finally, Ed will provide an exclusive, behind-the-scenes sneak peek of the free SANS Holiday Hack Challenge, sharing unique insights and lessons learned this annual event that is the most popular CtF in the world.
