# The Hackerâ€™s Guide to Mentorship: Fostering the Diverse Workforce of the Future | HackFest 2021
Mentoring is often used to foster talent within an organization, pairing a junior employee with a more senior high performer. The mentee learns to mirror the behaviors of the mentor, which can be key to advancement. However, it can also lead to a subconscious bias, where employees end up hiring people just like them. This results in organizations that are homogeneous in their thoughts, viewpoints, backgrounds, ideas, perspectives, and approaches to problem solving. In a pen testing context, this leads to similar approaches to vulnerability discovery, testing, and results analysis. Pen testing is all about repeatable processes, and when you don't change, you don't learn anything or find anything new. Pen testers need a new approach to mentorship, one that recognizes the impact of a diversified workforce on business outcomes such as increasing innovation, diversifying skill sets, increasing motivation and engagement, and, critically, retain high-potential talent. The Hacker's Guide to Mentorship provides an outline of how to improve your bottom line by fixing your talent problem.
