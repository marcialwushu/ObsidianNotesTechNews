# ATT&CKing Offensive Operations | Pen Test HackFest Summit 2021
ATT&CKing Offensive Operations is a story about how the small T. Rowe Price internal Red Team transitioned from a penetration testing team to an adversary emulation and purple teaming power house. Having previously worked for the MITRE Corporation, I brought my passion for adversary emulation and the ATT&CK framework to T. Rowe Price and enhanced their Red Team program. Topics such as adversary emulation, purple teaming, and assumed breach will all be discussed in a practical sense. Additionally, all the lessons learned and first hand experiences while making this transition will be shared. Presenter: Scott Taylor, Senior Red Team Operator, T. Rowe Price https://www.sans.org/profiles/scott-taylor/ View upcoming Summits: http://www.sans.org/u/DuS Download the presentation slides (SANS account required) at https://www.sans.org/u/1iaE
