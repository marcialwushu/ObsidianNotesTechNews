# Offensive GoLang 2.0 | Pen Test HackFest Summit 2021
The Go programming language offers capabilities that really optimize red team tool development. Go is a simple language that is easy to learn and easy to use. Go programs can be compiled for Windows, Mac, and Linux from a single code base, saving precious time. For these reasons, real-world adversaries are actively using Go to develop current malware. It is up to us to model these threats to keep networks safe! This talk will demonstrate how the Go programming language can be used to support common red team tool development activities. Attendees will enjoy several demos showcasing Go's awesome offensive applications including creating cross platform executables, injecting A/V resilient shellcode, payload hardening, and more. At the conclusion of this presentation, viewers will have a strong understanding of how Go can be used to create simple, reliable, and scalable offensive tools, plus recommendations for mitigating the threat of Go-based malware.
