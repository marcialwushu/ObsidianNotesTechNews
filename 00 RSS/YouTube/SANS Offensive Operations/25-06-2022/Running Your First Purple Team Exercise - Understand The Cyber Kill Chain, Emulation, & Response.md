# Running Your First Purple Team Exercise - Understand The Cyber Kill Chain, Emulation, & Response
Relevant Courses: https://www.sans.org/sec599, https://www.sans.org/sec699 Presented by: Jorge Orchilles Follow me here: https://twitter.com/jorgeorchilles In this webinar we will define what Purple Team is and how to build a high-value Purple Team program. We will cover consuming actionable Cyber Threat Intelligence, emulating attacks, and detection engineering to ensure your organization (people, process, and technology) can detect and respond to a similar attack when it inevitably occurs. No matter your role or area of specialization this presentation will be beneficial to your security practices. Attendees coming from a vulnerability management background will learn how to evolve from CVEs to TTPs while defenders will be able to understand how attacks work so they can detect and respond to them quicker. We will use MITRE ATT&CK as the common language between all these teams to build an efficient and effective purple team program.
