# Testing for Differential Privacy Bugs
We are excited to introduce our third guest author in this blog series, Dan Kifer, Professor of Computer Science at Penn State. Dr. Kiferâ€™s research spans many topics related to differential privacy and social data, and a selection of his work represents the state of the art in the subject of this blog post: testing methods for detecting differential privacy bugs. - Joseph Near and David Darais In the last post, we learned that it is fairly easy to introduce bugs in the design and implementation of differentially private algorithms. We also learned that it can be difficult to find them. In
