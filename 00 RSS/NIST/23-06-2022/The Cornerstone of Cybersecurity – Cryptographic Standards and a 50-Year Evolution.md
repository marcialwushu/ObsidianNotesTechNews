# The Cornerstone of Cybersecurity – Cryptographic Standards and a 50-Year Evolution
In today’s connected digital world, cryptographic algorithms are implemented in every device and applied to every link to protect information in transmission and in storage. Over the past 50 years, the use of cryptographic tools has expanded dramatically, from limited environments like ATM encryption to every digital application used today. Throughout this long journey, NIST has played a unique leading role in developing critical cryptographic standards. Data Encryption Standard (DES) In the early 1970s, there was little public understanding of cryptography, although most people knew that
