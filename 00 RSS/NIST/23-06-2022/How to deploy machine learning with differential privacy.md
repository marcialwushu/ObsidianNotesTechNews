# How to deploy machine learning with differential privacy
We are delighted to introduce the final guest authors in our blog series, Nicolas Papernot and Abhradeep Thakurta, research scientists at Google Brain, whose research explores applications of differential privacy to machine learning. - Joseph Near and David Darais Previous posts in this series have explored differential privacy for traditional data analytics tasks, such as aggregate queries over database tables. What if we want to use state-of-the-art techniques like machine learning? Can we achieve differential privacy for these tasks, too? Machine learning is increasingly being used for
