# The Application of Cybersecurity for IoT Capabilities to Real-World Scenarios
NIST has a history of collaboration between its programs, which helps maximize project impacts and practicality to industry. One great example is between NIST’s National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) and the Cybersecurity for the Internet of Things (IoT) Program. Recent project reports from the NCCoE include mappings of relevant IoT device cybersecurity capabilities and nontechnical supporting capabilities; these three mappings align NIST’s IoT cybersecurity guidance with real-world implementation approaches: Securing Telehealth Remote Patient Monitoring Ecosystem Securing
