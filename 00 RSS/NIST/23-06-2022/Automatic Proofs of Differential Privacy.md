# Automatic Proofs of Differential Privacy
We are excited to introduce our fourth guest author in this blog series, Chike Abuah, PhD student in computer science at the University of Vermont, whose research expands the state of the art in the subject of this blog post: static and dynamic analysis approaches to automatic proofs of differential privacy. - Joseph Near and David Darais Previously, we have discussed some differentially private algorithms and implementation bugs which can cause these algorithms to fail to protect privacy in practice. Previous posts have described two ways of addressing this problem: automated testing and
