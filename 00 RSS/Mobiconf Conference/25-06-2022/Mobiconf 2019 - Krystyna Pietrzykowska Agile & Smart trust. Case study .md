# Mobiconf 2019 | Krystyna Pietrzykowska "Agile & Smart trust. Case study"
Krystyna Pietrzykowska presenting at Mobiconf 2019 conference in Krakow, Poland, October 3rd-4th Agile & Smart trust. Case study Krystyna has followed the path from software designer and developer to the director of the software engineering department in Motorola Solutions. This makes her one of the most influential women in the new technology sector. She graduated from AGH University of Science and Technology in Krakow, where she was the only female student among 80 male students. She currently, as the independent adviser, supports companies on the path of transformation in the areas of leadership and management, organisational culture, team building, and people development. She is not directed by gender equality, although she does value “feminine” qualities: multi-tasking and flexibility, and even the skill to question earlier decisions. She emphasises that the ability to look at problems through the wider perspective of a female-programmer helps during problem-solving.
