# Mobiconf 2019 | Scott Alexander-Bown "What’s ‘Q’ in Android Security"
Scott Alexander-Bown presenting at Mobiconf 2019 conference in Krakow, October 3rd-4th. What’s ‘Q’ in Android Security With the first decade now in the rearview mirror, Google launches us into the next decade of Android with Q. Consistent with the last few releases, Google is focusing ever more on privacy, updatablity and platform hardening. Beyond the platform improvements, I’ll cover the breaking changes and what you’ll need to update to be compatible when running on, and/or targeting Q. This is particularly important if your app uses location, external storage or system alert windows. We’ll also cover 2 exciting new encryption libraries from Google AndroidX Security and Adiantum, as well as security best practices that align with Android Q.
