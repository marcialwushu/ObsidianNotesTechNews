Clifton Lin presenting at Mobiconf 2019 conference in Krakow, Poland, October 3rd-4th Navigating dramas of the 3 legged stool Design, product and engineering form the core, functional unit (a 3 legged stool) in companies to execute on ideas, solving problems for the users and business. In this talk, we’ll look at how to build a solid foundation and relationship between the 3 legs of the stool, and best practices for designers to collaborate with cross functional peers to achieve great, sustainable results, while having fun in the process! I’ll also illustrate these perspectives by looking at a case study with the recent launch of the brand new Play Store, and highlight the techniques applied and learnings along the way. Designers in both small and large companies will walk away a more effective collaborator and team builder.
