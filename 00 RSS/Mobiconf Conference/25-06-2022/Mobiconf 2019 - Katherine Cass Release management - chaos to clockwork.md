# Mobiconf 2019 | Katherine Cass "Release management - chaos to clockwork"
Release Management: Chaos to Clockwork Perhaps your team’s product, or startup, has started hitting the heavy growth curve, and your current shoot-from-the-hip method of shipping change & managing production simply isn’t scaling. Or perhaps your product has been in existence for years, supporting large, long-tenured customers reluctant to change- but your engineers are drowning in antiquated process in desperate need of an overhaul. Either way, the process of deployment & quality of releases are “generally bad” for both customers and your engineering teams. How do you break “generally bad” down to actionable items your company can address to improve the deployment process measurably? By the end of this presentation, you’ll be armed with actionable goals that will change the quality of your product deployment process from patchwork to pristine.
