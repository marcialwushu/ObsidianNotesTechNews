# Paulina Sadowska | Do you need the Jetpack Macrobenchmark library?
At the last Google I/O, a new library was introduced, created to help us measure app performance: Jetpack Macrobanchmark. What is it? How is it different from the “regular” benchmarks introduced a few years back? And most importantly: when is using it worth the hassle and when it’s better to simply use something else? At this presentation, I’ll also share my personal experience with integrating the Jetpack Benchmark library into CI – what went well and what I wish I did differently.
