# Future Crimes

NEW YORK TIMES and WALL STREET JOURNAL BESTSELLER â€¢ AMAZON'S BEST BUSINESS BOOK OF 2015 â€¢ From former FBI Futurist, Interpol advisor and beat copâ€”a deep dive into the digital underground illuminating the alarming ways criminals, corporations, and countries are using new technologies against youâ€”and how this makes everyone more vulnerable. Technological advances have benefited our world in immeasurable ways, but there is an ominous flip side: our technology can be turned against us. And just over the horizon is a tidal wave of scientific progress that will leave our heads spinningâ€”from implantable medical devices to drones and 3-D printers, all of which can be hacked, with disastrous consequences. With explosive insights based on a career in law enforcement and counterterrorism, leading authority on global security Marc Goodman takes readers on a vivid journey through the darkest recesses of the Internet. He explores how bad actors are primed to hijack the technologies of tomorrow. Provocative, thrilling, and ultimately empowering, Future Crimes will serve as an urgent call to action that shows how we can take back control of our own devices and harness technologyâ€™s tremendous power for the betterment of humanityâ€”before itâ€™s too late.
