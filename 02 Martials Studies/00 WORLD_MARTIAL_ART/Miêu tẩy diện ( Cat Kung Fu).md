# Miêu tẩy diện ( Cat Kung Fu)
Miêu tẩy diện (Cat kung fu) is a style of fighting adapted from the cat's postures and movements and as such, it elevates the status of the cat to that of other awe-inspiring animals, such as the tiger, dragon and eagle after which animals many world-famous styles of martial arts have been named. Ancient Vietnamese were good at self-protection because they had to fight against savage animals, thieves, robbers, and other enemies. In the beginning, their kung fu was based mostly on everyday activities such as hunting animals, climbing trees, plowing land, and rowing boats. At the same time, they observed how certain animals hunted their prey and then imitated their postures and movements. Not surprisingly, they did not neglect the cat, a skilled hunter and a familiar household animal to them. To the ancient people, cats were an extremely smart and faithful animal that were loved and treated as a friend in the family. Their effective hunting skills and special fighting style gave ancient Vietnamese an idea about developing a style of fighting that captures the cat's strengths -- quick attack, quiet retreat, sharp observation, high jumping, fast running, effortless movements and extremely nimble postures. The cat-like fighting style, existing in a preliminary form next to other animal-based forms of kung fu, such as the tigers, m!onkey!s, snakes, became a vital instrument for ancient Vietnamese to deal with dangers and challenges. Over time, the postures and movements of the cat were systematized and developed into a full-fledged form of martial arts. In fact, the cat kung fu helped to diversify the many Vietnamese schools of fighting and enrich the national treasure of traditional martial arts.
