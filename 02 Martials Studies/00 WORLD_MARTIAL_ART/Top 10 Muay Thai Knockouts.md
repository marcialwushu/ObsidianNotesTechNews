# Top 10 Muay Thai Knockouts
The list is (obviously) subjective, just wanted to show my personal top 10 favorite knockouts from Muay Thai. Not orchestrated by the importance of match ups or KO's against elite opponents but rather knockouts that please the eyes most! These are just my favorites, everyone has their own. Feel free to commentate your favorite ones as well, I am always happy to see new ones that I haven't seen yet myself Intro video (Wai Kru by Buakaw) from Amazing Thailand channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5JuxcvYg9Y Intro song: Epic Music VN - Unforgiven I have already made up a video of my top 10 kickboxing knockouts, here is one of Muay Thai and will make my TOP 10 favorite MMA knockouts at some point as well
