Pode ser tão simples quando um PUT o POST /qrcode. Daí, a confirmação do pagamento poderia vir pela notificação do webhook. O que ainda não vi é a questão de TXID, pois se for gerado pelo pagador, como identificar o pagamento na notificação?\n\nJá para atender o lado pagador, a coisa complica devida às diferentes regras e funcionalidades propostas\nRubens Kuhl — Possivelmente o POST do /qrcode retorne o txid. O problema é garantir idempotência. O que me ocorre é o QR-Code ter um PaymentID do pagador cujo objetivo seja apenas esse de idempotência, não de conciliação. Então se fizer o POST do mesmo QR-Code duas vezes, retorna o mesmo TXID.\nSean Wykes — Aí fica bacana. Como o QR pagador é completamente diferente do QR PIX atual, não precisa nem ter um TXID, então este pode ser gerado pelo recebedor ou seu PSP, e o PSP recebedor manter a relação entre os dois (PaymentID, TXID). Ao chegar no PSP pagador, será disparado o pagamento com o TXID do recebedor normalmente, assim funcionando o webhook e as consultas, inclusive um GET /qrcode/{txid} etc\n</code></pre>",

Our tools verify cyber requirements against a formal model of the system architecture, using both integrated model checking and information flow analysis. We track the satisfaction of cyber requirements throughout the design process by creating an assurance case that is integrated with the AADL system architecture model. Developers can select from our library of design patterns, including space and time partitioning, and verified cyber-resilient components such as verified filters, to address cyber requirements. Our automated model transformation tools help the developers apply these design patterns and insert these components into their designs. Our HAMR code generation framework automatically generates cyber-resilient implementations from the verified design model using high-assurance components and property-preserving transformations. Our AADL-to-code generators can target Linux or the formally verified seL4 microkernel. The tools have been demonstrated on an enhancement to a mission computing system in a military helicopter to demonstrate effectiveness of the approach on a real avionics system.\n\nDarren Cofer is a Fellow at Collins Aerospace. He earned his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from The University of Texas at Austin.\n\nHis principal area of expertise is developing and applying advanced analysis methods and tools for verification and certification of high-integrity systems. His background includes work with formal methods for system and software analysis, the design of real-time embedded systems for safety-critical applications, and the development of nuclear propulsion systems in the U.S. Navy.\nHe has served as principal investigator on government-sponsored research programs with NASA, NSA, AFRL, and DARPA, developing and using formal methods for verification of safety and security properties.

          "description": "This presentation by Scot Wrocklage and Alek Taraskewich was given virtually at AADL/ACVIP User Day 2022.\n\nSikorsky, a Lockheed Martin company, provides an overview of how ACVIP processes are being interwoven into their digital thread for product development. This includes an overview of the types of ACVIP related tools and analyses that Sikorsky is or plans to be using and how they connect to other development processes and tools within the lifecycle. Sikorsky’s approach to ACVIP centers on ensuring model data is generated efficiently but still tightly coupled into a unambiguous authoritative source of truth.\n\nScot Wrocklage is an associate fellow and software architect for Lockheed Martin with 18+ years of experience in Embedded Software for Avionics and Mission Systems. Scot is passionate about continuous improvement and increasing process efficiencies, and he has led many successful transformations within his organization to achieve those goals in practice. Scot has been involved with ACVIP and AADL since 2019 and has been an avid proponent for the use of ACVIP to improve quality and reduce costs to development efforts within Sikorsky / Lockheed Martin. Scot is a graduate of Saginaw Valley State University with bachelor’s degrees in Electrical Engineering and Mathematics.\n\nAlek Taraskewich is a senior software engineer at Lockheed Martin who has spent 7+ years developing and testing embedded software for rotorcraft. Alek has made significant contributions to the automation of test activities within Sikorsky and has brought that automation mind set to his work with ACVIP and AADL. Alek has been working with the Sikorsky ACVIP initiatives in the last 2 years and has been instrumental in helping to shape the Sikorsky approach to ACVIP. Prior to working at Sikorsky, Alek was working with turbofan electronic engine control computers and rich web applications. He has a bachelor’s degree in Electronic Game and Interactive Development and is currently writing his graduate thesis on Real-Time Deep Visual Odometry for Mobile Systems.",

AADL is a modeling language used for Model Based Engineering and targeted at real-time embedded systems. By understanding the quantitative effects of an attack on an AADL system model, design decisions affecting Cyber Resiliency can be made early in the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This supports one of the Cyber Resiliency goals of building a system that can withstand an attack. Key Performance Parameters (KPPs) related to Cyber Resiliency may then be established and measured based on the system models developed using AADL.\n\nDr. Ricardo J. Rodriguez is a Raytheon Intelligence and Space (RI&S) Senior Engineering Fellow with over 23 years of experience and a subject matter expert in the areas of Systems Security Engineering, Software Assurance, Cybersecurity, Computer Networking, and related C2 capabilities.\n\nBefore joining RI&S, he was the Radar Product Line cybersecurity lead engineer, where he helped define technical direction, long-range technical road maps, and planning for achieving cybersecurity technical goals that support program and organizational objectives. Cyber Ricky, as he is referred to, works meticulously to maintain his knowledge and skills in the cybersecurity domain.\n\nAfter joining RI&S in 2019, Ricky has supported over fifteen proposal efforts while providing technical leadership to over 10 programs as well as cybersecurity consulting to many more across multiple mission areas.\n\nIn the area of Diversity and Inclusion, Ricky has held many roles since joining Raytheon in 2001, culminating with a 2-yr term as HOLA Global President and RTX Diversity and Inclusion Committee member.\n\nRicky, who has been awarded six patents, one trade secret, and multiple innovation awards, has also instructed both internally and externally. He holds bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer engineering from the University of Puerto Rico-Mayaguez, and a Ph.D. in engineering-cybersecurity from Nova Southeastern University.

Perhaps it’s to catch threat actors earlier in the attack. Maybe, it’s to cover more detection opportunities in case a threat changes some procedures. In any instance, detection engineering should be driven by intelligence to ensure coverage of real-world threats targeting your organization.\n\nThis webinar will cover the detection engineering process and how operationalized purple teaming drives it. Every environment is unique and needs custom detections tailored to the environment and its threats. Operationalized purple teaming shows us, with a certain degree of confidence, what it would look like if a threat were to attack. Purple team emulations allow Blue Teams and Detection Engineers to check log sources and develop detections around common questions like, “is it normal for the targeted process to behave this way in our environment?” Join us to learn more about threat-informed detection engineering and how it fits into Purple Teaming.",

On this date, our industry was struck with a new disaster; CVE-2-21-44228, also known as Log4Shell. A newly discovered vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 Java library allows attackers to execute remote code on affected systems and those affected systems are everywhere from web sites and applications to the web interfaces of IoT devices. This vulnerability is serious, with a CVSS threat rating of 10 out of 10 and I don't really care, because I’m prepared and not just scrambling to patch.\n\nHow would you like to never have to worry about the newest vulnerability or the latest attack vector? How would you like an IT environment that would be easier to attack physically than \"over the wire\" for the attacker? How would you like to not care about Log4Shell, or whatever comes next? This webinar will provide active defense strategies not just for addressing Log4Shell but, also for addressing the next big vulnerability, and the one after that. Using cyber deception and active engagement techniques, an attacker compromising your network has just entered a field of land mines where any misstep results in the detection and immediate response. The topics discussed in this webinar will seem too good to be true. I promise you, they are not. Learn to change the paradigm. Create a situation where the attacker needs to be right 100% of the time while defenders only need to be right once. Learn how we take back the advantage.",

The field of security practitioners has heavily relied on individual expertise to tackle this scaling challenge over the past decade. Ransomware groups and other threat actors have continued to adapt with new tactics, techniques, and procedures as the profitability of cyber crime continues to provide adversaries with significant resources. These destructive groups have brought the discussion of cybersecurity to every business and individual's front door, so why does such a scaling gap for security testing still exist? The resource shift has caused a massive imbalance for defenders, especially those that rely on individual expertise since it cannot scale well by itself. Automation of adversary behaviors is increasingly important for organizations to understand how their security posture will fare against the latest adversaries. This talk will take attendees through a story of information security challenges with adversary automation, scaling, and present a path forward. Audiences can expect to walk away with a broader understanding of the challenges of adversary automation, where to evaluate risk with automation, and how we as testers can communicate the nuances of automation in our workflows with customers and clients.\n\nPresenter: Timothy Schulz, Adversary Emulation Lead, SCYTHE Inc.\nhttps://www.sans.org/profiles/timothy-schulz/\n\nView upcoming Summits: http://www.sans.org/u/DuS\nDownload the presentation slides (SANS account required) at https://www.sans.org/u/1iaE",

The mentee learns to mirror the behaviors of the mentor, which can be key to advancement. However, it can also lead to a subconscious bias, where employees end up hiring people just like them. This results in organizations that are homogeneous in their thoughts, viewpoints, backgrounds, ideas, perspectives, and approaches to problem solving. In a pen testing context, this leads to similar approaches to vulnerability discovery, testing, and results analysis. Pen testing is all about repeatable processes, and when you don't change, you don't learn anything or find anything new. Pen testers need a new approach to mentorship, one that recognizes the impact of a diversified workforce on business outcomes such as increasing innovation, diversifying skill sets, increasing motivation and engagement, and, critically, retain high-potential talent.

Over the past decade, the OLCF security team has been sharpening its penetration testing skills to discover and ultimately fix zero day vulnerabilities on these systems. Using language inspired by the 1995 classic movie 'Hackers', we will examine several zero day vulnerabilities discovered during deployment of the Summit supercomputer and will provide visual demonstration of exploitation. Attendees will learn how the OLCF's security hardening strategy was scoped, developed, and executed to hopefully give *you* ammunition to convince *your* organization to support coordinated red/blue/purple team engagements. Specifically, this talk will explore what did and did not work during the management buy-in, engagement planning, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and vulnerability disclosure phases of the engagement. Overall, the exercise taught us that both offensive and defensive skills must be exercised in order to provide a high level of security assurance to our organization. In OLCF's case, Hacking the Gibson was a fruitful exercise to help secure HPC systems across the Department of Energy.\n\nPresenter: Ryan Adamson, HPC Security and Information Engineering Group Lead, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\nhttps://www.sans.org/profiles/ryan-adamson/\n\nView upcoming Summits: http://www.sans.org/u/DuS\nDownload the presentation slides (SANS account required) at https://www.sans.org/u/1iaE",

PCTE is a cloud-based training platform supporting individual sustainment training, team certification, and provides the foundation for collective training exercises (i.e. Cyber Flag, Cyber Guard). PCTE leverages existing connectivity and is a cloud-based environment to facilitate the sharing of resources (such as scenarios and content), and provide additional cyber \"maneuver space\" (such as emulated Red, Blue, Gray, and Industrial Control System (ICS) environments). PCTE enables realistic training with variable conditions to increase readiness and lethality of our Cyberspace Forces, while simplifying and automating the training management process.\n\nProgram Characteristics:\n\nIntegration: Integrate existing and future cyber training capabilities into the standard PCTE platform.\nEnvironment: Integrate Red, Blue, Gray, and Industrial Control System (ICS) environments.\nEvent Management: Software that rapidly facilitates the planning and execution of individual, team, and collective training.\nConnectivity: Provides compute, storage, and leverages existing transport to enable persistent and available training, assessment, and mission rehearsal capability.",

          "description": "Presented by: Ismael Valenzuela, Douglas McKee\nFollow Ismael here: https://twitter.com/aboutsecurity\nFollow Douglas here: https://twitter.com/fulmetalpackets\n\nNation-states and threat actors are increasingly targeting industrial networks and critical infrastructure. As part of their attacks, they often conduct extensive reconnaissance to discover vulnerabilities that can give them access and full control over critical systems. Some of these may even have the potential to threaten the safety of citizens and personnel inside targeted facilities.\n\nOften we find vendors using proprietary protocols to communicate on our networks. Naturally, these protocols are harder to understand and protect due to a lack of publicly available information. As a result, sophisticated attackers are taking the time to analyze these protocols for vulnerabilities as they too often go unprotected by organizations.\n\nIn this webinar, Douglas McKee and Ismael Valenzuela, using their combined 30 years of experience in cybersecurity, will walk through how an adversary can dissect and understand proprietary protocols on your network to find vulnerabilities or leak sensitive information. These same techniques can be used by red teamers as well as blue teamers, to emulate behaviors and anticipate the adversary. We will provide insights using real data embedded into proprietary networking protocols used by vendors and the techniques needed to breakdown and understand this information.",

With over 25 courses in total, spanning topics ranging from introductory penetration testing and hardware hacking, all the way to advanced exploit writing and advanced red teaming, it made sense to identify a name that encompasses all of the underlying offensive-oriented courses and topic areas. Thus, Offensive Operations was born. The courses within the curriculum are now broken up into focus areas including penetration testing, red teaming, purple teaming, and exploit development.\n\nIn this webcast, Stephen Sims elaborates on these updates and speaks about the 9 exciting new courses we have in development.\n\nSpeaker Bio\nStephen Sims is an industry expert with over 15 years of experience in information technology and security. Stephen currently works out of San Francisco as a consultant. He has spent many years performing security architecture, exploit development, reverse engineering, and penetration testing. Stephen has an MS in information assurance from Norwich University and is a course author and senior instructor for the SANS Institute. He is the author of SANS' only 700-level course, SEC760: Advanced Exploit Development for Penetration Testers, which concentrates on complex heap overflows, patch diffing, and client-side exploits. Stephen is also the lead author on SEC660: Advanced Penetration Testing, Exploits, and Ethical Hacking and co-author of SEC599: Defeating Advanced Adversaries – Purple Team Tactics & Kill Chain Defenses. He holds the GIAC Security Expert (GSE) certification as well as the CISSP, CISA, Immunity NOP, and many other certifications. In his spare time, Stephen enjoys snowboarding and writing music.",

Unfortunately, as we have seen countless times in the past, when you pit static technology against a creative, determined human being, the human always wins. Fortunately, there is an answer; cyber deception. Cyber deception targets the human that is the attacker, creating a situation where they are unknowingly influenced to take actions advantageous to defenders. If they become aware of the deception, they are then forced to question every aspect of their interaction with their target ultimately slowing them down. Best of all, attackers don't need to fall victim to every deceptive tactic. All it takes is for the attacker to stumble across a single deceptive resource and they are caught. It is often said that defenders must be right 100% of the time while attackers need to be right once.\n\nCyber deception flips that paradigm on its head by creating a situation where attackers must be right 100% of the time while defenders must be right just once. If implemented effectively, cyber deception creates a scenario where it is easier for an attacker to physically break in to a facility to affect compromise than to break in \"over the wire\" without getting caught. In the past, attackers had many advantages over defenders. From simple netcat listeners and fake credentials to deceptive web sites and fake social networking content, in this talk, you will learn the fundamentals, directly from new SANS course SEC550: Cyber Deception - Attack Detection, Disruption and Active Defense, of how cyber deception can allow defenders to truly take back the advantage!",

          "description": "AWS and Azure cloud environments are the most widely used so naturally more research, tools, examples, and presentations have focused on these environments. However, what if your team (or you) need to assess a GCP environment? GCP documentation on using the environment isn't very intuitive. Therefore, when targeting a GCP environment for a red team engagement, it can prove very costly in terms of ramp up time, and the finished assessment can lack important insights and details. In this talk, we will address these problems by providing a detailed guide and examples on how to navigate Adversary Simulations through GCP. We will cover how to get an initial foothold, map to important objects, identify juicy permissions and leverage compromised account(s) to quickly zero in on critical targets with those permissions. GCP has thousands of IAM permissions and while this can be a daunting time waster, we don't need to learn about them all. We only need a small subset to achieve our objective. We will also demonstrate different methods that can be used to persist in GCP in a stealthy manner by abusing various resources. Based on how GCP is configured, a red teamer can run into issues with traditional C2 tools. In this scenario, we will show how you can successfully use Google's own products as Command & Control to bypass otherwise restricted C2 call backs. Next, we will show how to identify and leverage firewall rules of interest, as well as, the compute instances they are applied to and how to manipulate them when you don't find the firewall rules for the desired access. In closing, we will show how Cloud Key Management Service ( KMS ) integration works with Google Cloud Storage ( GCS ), as well as how to abuse it to decrypt and exfiltrate target data.\n\nPresenter: Madhav Bhatt, Offensive Security Engineer, Credit Karma\nhttps://www.sans.org/profiles/madhav-bhatt/\nPresenter: Brad Richardson, Credit Karma\nhttps://www.sans.org/profiles/brad-richardson/\n\nView upcoming Summits: http://www.sans.org/u/DuS\nDownload the presentation slides (SANS account required) at https://www.sans.org/u/1iaE",

          "description": "APIs have become the de facto standard on software development all over the world. Every organization is creating and publishing its own APIs, even banks and e-commerce sites. They are developed when organizations want to share their services without exposing sensitive information like their database structure. But what about the security of those services? Are they well protected? Even RSAC, one of the most significant information security conferences globally, had an API vulnerability in their mobile app that leaked some user's first and last names in 2018. In this talk, we'll show a few basic steps that you can take today to start looking for vulnerabilities in APIs. From the level of exposure to information sensitivity going through the ability to change data, you can check and look for different things when testing an API. We'll demonstrate some not-so-standard tools for testing APIs and some common vulnerabilities you can find by using them.\n\nPresenter: Magno Logan, Information Security Specialist, Trend Micro\nhttps://www.sans.org/profiles/magno-logan/\n\nView upcoming Summits: http://www.sans.org/u/DuS\nDownload the presentation slides (SANS account required) at https://www.sans.org/u/1iaE",

No amount of personal heroics, technical awesomesauce, or the world's great tool is going to change that and have the business suddenly get it. So how do we get them to care? We'll talk how to get leadership buy-in for your offsec program, how to translate this for different kinds of offensive assessments (vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, red teaming, and purple teaming), metrics (including real-world data) derived from a detection maturity model I created with business context (alignment).

But what good is finding vulnerabilities if your client doesn't understand or care about your findings? I offer my unusual perspective to this talk. Yes, I understand pen testing as a trade. I cowrote The Pen Tester Blueprint and I run Hack The Box's blog. But frankly, my professional focus has always been communicating my ideas. Especially to a business audience who only understands dollars and cents. In this talk, I will share (fictional for the sake of protecting sensitive information) examples of both well written and poorly written pen tester reports. I will emphasize how to not only explain vulnerabilities effectively, but also how to make business people care about addressing vulnerabilities for the sake of protecting their bottom line. One of the hardest things about cybersecurity bis getting \"the suits\" to allocate a decent security budget.

          "description": "Palestra ministrada pelo Prof.Dr. Aldo von Wangenheim (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, Brasil) no III Ciclo de Seminários de Tecnologias de Informação em Saúde, organizado pela Diretoria de Educação e Capacitação Profissional da Sociedade Brasileira de Informática em Saúde (SBIS), em agosto de 2012.\n\nResumo da palestra:\n\nConvergência digital (CD) é o fenômeno em que diferentes funcionalidades convergem para seu uso um único dispositivo. Um smartphone moderno, por exemplo, é um dispositivo que congrega diferentes funções de comunicação, entretenimento e computação, permitindo mensagens instantânes, email, visualização de filmes, fotografia, filmagem, videoconferência e, claro, também serve para telefonar. O desafio da CD não é mais o de se produzir plataformas convergentes, mas sim sistematizar e tornar eficiente o processo de concepção e produção de aplicações e conteúdo multidispositivo. Assim, é necessário criar-se orientações/diretrizes de usabilidade para o desenvolvimento de sistemas de software multi-dispositivo considerando várias formas inovadoras de interação. Atualmente estamos ainda no período de inovação, em um cenário crescente de dispositivos digitais (iPads, telefones celulares, TV digital interativa, etc.). A CD já está demonstrando um enorme impacto no setor saúde, através de aplicativos e utilizações específicas. Nesta palestra falaremos sobre como isto está ocorrendo e as perspectivas da CD para o futuro.\n\nCurrículo do palestrante:\n\nProf. Dr. Aldo von Wangenheim\n\nPossui graduação em Ciências da Computação pela Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (1989) e Doutorado Acadêmico (Dr. rer.nat.) em Ciências da Computação pela Universidade de Kaiserslautern (1996).

Muitas destas novas técnicas encontram-se interligadas causando alguma dificuldade em distinguir os diferentes conceitos de computação, informática, telecomunicação, tecnologia de informação e novas tecnologias.

Ainda que limitado, incluímos freqüentemente neste termo todas as novas tecnologias aplicadas a Medicina, voltadas para a produção de estruturas de representação de dados e de conhecimentos. A busca de um melhor entendimento nos processos e nos relacionamentos complexos, visando o desenvolvimento de métodos de aquisição e de representação de dados, evitam a sobrecarga de informações, além de gerenciar as mudanças necessárias nos usuários, nos processos e nas tecnologias empregadas, otimizando o uso de informações, e promovendo a integração de processos de modo a oferecer a melhor performance para cada cenário. Uma atitude mais racional é a de entender o potencial das novas tecnologias à luz do conhecimento de suas qualidades e limitações. A Medicina é uma das atividades mais tradicionais e conservadoras de toda sociedade. Esta postura pode retardar alguns processos mas resulta numa filtragem de novas tecnologias que fracassaram ao serem implantadas em setores onde a incorporação tecnológica é costumeiramente mais rápida.\n\nCurrículo do Palestrante\n\nDr. Marivan Santiago Abrahão\n\nClínico Geral e Nefrologista.

Está sendo estudado agora a certificação profissional internacional, mediante a aplicação de um exame padronizado, e a criação de um cadastro nacional de especialistas, voltado para o mercado de trabalho de consultores, desenvolvedores, professores, etc. Nesta palestra serão explicados os\nvários componentes deste projeto, como estão funcionando, como os associados e não associados podem participar, etc.\n\nCurrículo do Palestrante:\n\nRenato Marcos Endrizzi Sabbatini\n\nCientista biomédico, doutor pela Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto da Universidade de São Paulo, e professor adjunto aposentado da Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP), onde fundou e dirigiu por 20 anos o Núcleo de Informática Biomédica e foi chefe da área de Informática Biomédica e Bioestatística da Faculdade de Ciências Biomédicas, e membro do Grupo de Educação a Distância da Universidade. Foi também fundador e presidente da Sociedade Brasileira de Informática em Saúde, sendo atualmente seu Diretor de Educação e Formação Profissional.

Prof.Dr. Lincoln de Assis Moura Jr, diretor de relações internacionais da SBIS, tesoureiro e presidente eleito da IMIA.\n\nResumo da palestra:\n\nA IMIA é a Associação Internacional de Infomática Médica (www.imia.org). Ela nasceu há 40 anos e naquele tempo o conceito de Informática em Saúde era poderoso como é hoje. No entanto, a IMIA cobre tudo o que hoje se chama de Informática em Saúde, Informática BioMédica ou mesmo eHealth. A IMIA congrega sociedades centíficas, empresas, organzações acadêmicas e mesmo indivíduos de mais de 85 países. O grande objetivo, e o grande dilema da IMIA, são muito parecidos com os objetivos e os dilemas da própria SBIS, o que é de se esperar, já que a IMIA é uma Federação de sociedades como a SBIS. Assim como a SBIS é vista com respeito e isenção no Brasil e pela comunidade internacional que nos conhece, a IMIA tem a excelente condição de representar conhecimento e isenção perante toda a comunidade internacional. Ao contrário do HL7 e do HIMSS que mesmo sendo internacionais são organizações de origem norte-americana e percebidos como tal, a IMIA tende a representar países. Isto torna a IMIA especial. O grande e inequívoco evento organizado pela IMIA é o Medinfo, mais uma identificação clara com o que acontence na SBIS, em relação ao CBIS. Nesta apresentação, iremos apresentar um pouco da história da IMIA, mostrar a sua organização em Grupos de Trabalho, falar das suas Regiões, das suas lideranças passadas e atuais, conversar sobre os desafios e omplanejamento estartégico que a IMIA persegue hoje, e, finalmente, conversar sobre o papel que nós brasileiros podemos ter nesta tão importante organização.\n\nCurrículo do palestrante:\n\nDr. Lincoln de Assis Moura Jr.\nEngenheiro Eletricista, modalidade Eletrônica, pela EESC-USP (1976), MSc em Engenharia Biomédica pelo Programa de Engenharia Biomédica da COPPE/UFRJ (1979) e PhD pelo Imperial College, Londres (1988). Depois de atuar como diretor de P&D da Divisão de Informática do InCor, Diretor de Informática do HC de São Paulo e Líder de Negócios de Saúde da Atech, hoje é presidente da Zilics Sistemas de Informação em Saúde. Foi presidente da SBIS - Sociedade Brasileira de Informática em Saúde por dois mandatos (2000 a 2004) e, em 2006, foi eleito tesoureiro da IMIA - International Medical Informatics Association para o termo 2007-2010.

Significa algo como \"saúde eletrônica\" ou \"saúde digital\". Todavia seu significado é muito mais amplo, e vem revolucionando a área da saúde em todo o mundo. Segundo a HIMSS - Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, eHealth é qualquer aplicação de Internet, utilizada em conjunto com outras tecnologias de informação, focada na melhoraria do acesso, da eficiência, da efetividade e da qualidadedos processos clínicos e assistenciais necessários a toda a cadeia de atendimento à saúde. O objetivo único é prover melhores condições de tratamento ao paciente e melhores condições de custeio ao Sistema de Saúde. O conceito de eHealth inclui muitas dimensões, que vão desde a entrega de informações clínicas aos parceiros da cadeia de atendimento, passando pelas facilidades de interação entre todos os seus membros, chegando a disponibilização dessa mesma informação nos mais difíceis e remotos lugares. Dentro do modelo encontra-se um conjunto de ferramentas e serviços capazes de sustentar o atendimento de forma integrada e através da WEB. Entre elas podemos citar algumas: Electronic Health Records (EHR, ou Prontuário Eletrônico do Paciente, PEP), Hospital Information Systems (HIS - Gestão Hospitalar), National Electronic Registries (Registro Nacional de Saúde), National Drug Registries (Controle Nacional de Medicamentos), Decision Support Systems (Suporte a Decisão Clinica), Community Health Management (Gestão da Comunidades de Saúde), Telessaúde, Telemedicina, comunidades virtuais e redes sociais, etc. Essas soluções, integrando todos os membros da comunidade, são o cerne do conceito de eSaúde, que serão explicadas e discutidas em seus fundamentos, conceitos, aplicações e estratégias, rumo a um projeto nacional.

Esta conexão permite que os computadores possam compartilhar recursos e coordenar atividades de forma a realizar uma tarefa comum. Existem vários desafios envolvidos no desenvolvimento de sistemas distribuídos, como: heterogeneidade de hardware e software, segurança, escalabilidade, tratamento de falhas, concorrência e transparência. Ao longo do tempo foram desenvolvidas várias tecnologias para a elaboração de sistemas distribuídos e que têm sido aplicadas, com maior ou menor sucesso, na área da Saúde. Especificações como o CIAS (Clinical Image Access System) e COAS (Clinical Observation Access System) ajudaram a determinar a evolução atual dos padrões de trocas de informações em Medicina. Atualmente, o uso de sistemas distribuídos em grid computacional é uma área promissora para aplicações médicas, uma vez que permite o processamento de dados extremamente volumosos e o compartilhamento de dados entre Instituições fisicamente separadas, mas com interesses comuns. Nesta apresentação serão apresentados conceitos de Sistemas Distribuídos e algumas tecnologias e soluções aplicadas para a área de Saúde. Serão apresentadas, também, algumas aplicações desenvolvidas no Instituto do Coração (InCor) - HCFMUSP que utilizam sistemas distribuídos.\n\nCurrículo do palestrante:\n\nDr. Ramon Alfredo Moreno\nGraduado pela Escola de Engenharia Elétrica de São Carlos (EESC-USP) em 1998 e Doutor em Engenharia Elétrica pela Escola Politécnica (EPUSP-2005). Desde 2002 é pesquisador do Instituto do Coração (InCor)-HCFMUSP na Unidade de Pesquisa e Desenvolvimento (P&D) do Serviço de Informática (Sinfo). Tem 10 anos de experiência com padrões abertos, CORBA, DICOM, WEB e programação Java. Desenvolveu e implementou o servidor DICOM, utilizado atualmente do Instituto do Coração, e foi coordenador de um projeto OpenSource, chamado MiniWEBPACS.

Profa.Dr. Magdala de Araújo Novaes, coordenadora do Núcleo de Tecnologias em Saúde (NUTES), RUTE-UFPE e Programa de Telessaúde Brasil em Pernambuco.\n\nResumo da palestra:\n\nO uso da telessaúde ou telemedicina nos serviços públicos de saúde vem crescendo a cada ano no Brasil. Em outros países não é diferente, a prática da telessaúde tem ampliado a oferta de saúde a comunidades isoladas ou desprovidas de serviços especializados. O suporte remoto as equipes que atuam na Estratégia de Saúde da Família no Brasil tem sido fundamental para melhorar a resolubilidade destas equipes, diminuir deslocamentos de pacientes e profissionais na rede e custos no sistema público de saúde. Mas o que é telessaúde? uma tecnologia ou um serviço? Vamos explorar as diferentes modalidades desta prática, seus recursos e principais atores, e estratégias adotadas para implantação da telessaúde na atenção primária no Brasil. O Programa Telessaúde Brasil será utilizado para exemplificar os diferentes cenários de uso. Discutir os diferentes impactos da prática da telessaúde pode ajudar a melhor desenvolver sua estratégia local de utilização para uma boa relação custo efetividade, além de entender seus limites e benefícios para o sistema de saúde como um todo.\n\nCurrículo do palestrante:\n\nProfa.Dra.Magdala de Araújo Novaes\nDoutora em Bioinformática pela Université D´Aix-Marseille II (França), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique em 1993, especializada em informática aplicada às organizações pela Université de Montpellier I (França), e graduada em Ciência da Computação pela Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE) em 1987 (Brasil).

In the beginning, their kung fu was based mostly on everyday activities such as hunting animals, climbing trees, plowing land, and rowing boats. At the same time, they observed how certain animals hunted their prey and then imitated their postures and movements. Not surprisingly, they did not neglect the cat, a skilled hunter and a familiar household animal to them.\r\n\r\nTo the ancient people, cats were an extremely smart and faithful animal that were loved and treated as a friend in the family. Their effective hunting skills and special fighting style gave ancient Vietnamese an idea about developing a style of fighting that captures the cat's strengths -- quick attack, quiet retreat, sharp observation, high jumping, fast running, effortless movements and extremely nimble postures.\r\n\r\nThe cat-like fighting style, existing in a preliminary form next to other animal-based forms of kung fu, such as the tigers, m!onkey!s, snakes, became a vital instrument for ancient Vietnamese to deal with dangers and challenges. Over time, the postures and movements of the cat were systematized and developed into a full-fledged form of martial arts.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the cat kung fu helped to diversify the many Vietnamese schools of fighting and enrich the national treasure of traditional martial arts.",
