Pode ser tão simples quando um PUT o POST /qrcode. Daí, a confirmação do pagamento poderia vir pela notificação do webhook. O que ainda não vi é a questão de TXID, pois se for gerado pelo pagador, como identificar o pagamento na notificação?\n\nJá para atender o lado pagador, a coisa complica devida às diferentes regras e funcionalidades propostas\nRubens Kuhl — Possivelmente o POST do /qrcode retorne o txid. O problema é garantir idempotência. O que me ocorre é o QR-Code ter um PaymentID do pagador cujo objetivo seja apenas esse de idempotência, não de conciliação. Então se fizer o POST do mesmo QR-Code duas vezes, retorna o mesmo TXID.\nSean Wykes — Aí fica bacana. Como o QR pagador é completamente diferente do QR PIX atual, não precisa nem ter um TXID, então este pode ser gerado pelo recebedor ou seu PSP, e o PSP recebedor manter a relação entre os dois (PaymentID, TXID). Ao chegar no PSP pagador, será disparado o pagamento com o TXID do recebedor normalmente, assim funcionando o webhook e as consultas, inclusive um GET /qrcode/{txid} etc\n</code></pre>",

To discuss this topic, we are delighted to introduce another guest author in our blog series, Claire McKay Bowen, Lead Data Scientist for Privacy and Data Security at the Urban Institute. Claire’s research focuses on assessing the quality of differentially private data synthesis methods and science communication. In 2021, the Committee of Presidents of Statistical Societies",

Our tools verify cyber requirements against a formal model of the system architecture, using both integrated model checking and information flow analysis. We track the satisfaction of cyber requirements throughout the design process by creating an assurance case that is integrated with the AADL system architecture model. Developers can select from our library of design patterns, including space and time partitioning, and verified cyber-resilient components such as verified filters, to address cyber requirements. Our automated model transformation tools help the developers apply these design patterns and insert these components into their designs. Our HAMR code generation framework automatically generates cyber-resilient implementations from the verified design model using high-assurance components and property-preserving transformations. Our AADL-to-code generators can target Linux or the formally verified seL4 microkernel.

Perhaps it’s to catch threat actors earlier in the attack. Maybe, it’s to cover more detection opportunities in case a threat changes some procedures. In any instance, detection engineering should be driven by intelligence to ensure coverage of real-world threats targeting your organization.\n\nThis webinar will cover the detection engineering process and how operationalized purple teaming drives it. Every environment is unique and needs custom detections tailored to the environment and its threats.

Perhaps it’s to catch threat actors earlier in the attack. Maybe, it’s to cover more detection opportunities in case a threat changes some procedures. In any instance, detection engineering should be driven by intelligence to ensure coverage of real-world threats targeting your organization.\n\nThis webinar will cover the detection engineering process and how operationalized purple teaming drives it. Every environment is unique and needs custom detections tailored to the environment and its threats. Operationalized purple teaming shows us, with a certain degree of confidence, what it would look like if a threat were to attack. Purple team emulations allow Blue Teams and Detection Engineers to check log sources and develop detections around common questions like, “is it normal for the targeted process to behave this way in our environment?” Join us to learn more about threat-informed detection engineering and how it fits into Purple Teaming.",

On this date, our industry was struck with a new disaster; CVE-2-21-44228, also known as Log4Shell. A newly discovered vulnerability in the Apache Log4j 2 Java library allows attackers to execute remote code on affected systems and those affected systems are everywhere from web sites and applications to the web interfaces of IoT devices. This vulnerability is serious, with a CVSS threat rating of 10 out of 10 and I don't really care, because I’m prepared and not just scrambling to patch.\n\nHow would you like to never have to worry about the newest vulnerability or the latest attack vector? How would you like an IT environment that would be easier to attack physically than \"over the wire\" for the attacker? How would you like to not care about Log4Shell, or whatever comes next? This webinar will provide active defense strategies not just for addressing Log4Shell but, also for addressing the next big vulnerability, and the one after that. Using cyber deception and active engagement techniques, an attacker compromising your network has just entered a field of land mines where any misstep results in the detection and immediate response. The topics discussed in this webinar will seem too good to be true. I promise you, they are not. Learn to change the paradigm. Create a situation where the attacker needs to be right 100% of the time while defenders only need to be right once. Learn how we take back the advantage.",

The field of security practitioners has heavily relied on individual expertise to tackle this scaling challenge over the past decade.

The mentee learns to mirror the behaviors of the mentor, which can be key to advancement. However, it can also lead to a subconscious bias, where employees end up hiring people just like them. This results in organizations that are homogeneous in their thoughts, viewpoints, backgrounds, ideas, perspectives, and approaches to problem solving. In a pen testing context, this leads to similar approaches to vulnerability discovery, testing, and results analysis.

These supercomputers employ first-of-its-kind hardware and software technologies in order to provide massive amounts of computational horsepower to teams that are performing open science computational research. Over the past decade, the OLCF security team has been sharpening its penetration testing skills to discover and ultimately fix zero day vulnerabilities on these systems. Using language inspired by the 1995 classic movie 'Hackers', we will examine several zero day vulnerabilities discovered during deployment of the Summit supercomputer and will provide visual demonstration of exploitation. Attendees will learn how the OLCF's security hardening strategy was scoped, developed, and executed to hopefully give *you* ammunition to convince *your* organization to support coordinated red/blue/purple team engagements. Specifically, this talk will explore what did and did not work during the management buy-in, engagement planning, vulnerability discovery, exploitation, and vulnerability disclosure phases of the engagement. Overall, the exercise taught us that both offensive and defensive skills must be exercised in order to provide a high level of security assurance to our organization. In OLCF's case, Hacking the Gibson was a fruitful exercise to help secure HPC systems across the Department of Energy.\n\nPresenter: Ryan Adamson, HPC Security and Information Engineering Group Lead, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\nhttps://www.sans.org/profiles/ryan-adamson/\n\nView upcoming Summits: http://www.sans.org/u/DuS\nDownload the presentation slides (SANS account required) at https://www.sans.org/u/1iaE",

Monaghan Jr., LTC, AR, Product Manager, PdM Cyber Resiliency & Training (CRT)\nCOLONEL Tanya R. Trout, TXARNG\n\nThe Persistent Cyber Training Environment (PCTE) addresses a critical and urgent need to provide a persistent and realistic training environment to Joint Cyber Mission Forces (CMF). To address this, PCTE is leveraging rapid acquisition and prototyping efforts to develop capability efficiently and quickly. PCTE is a cloud-based training platform supporting individual sustainment training, team certification, and provides the foundation for collective training exercises (i.e. Cyber Flag, Cyber Guard). PCTE leverages existing connectivity and is a cloud-based environment to facilitate the sharing of resources (such as scenarios and content), and provide additional cyber \"maneuver space\" (such as emulated Red, Blue, Gray, and Industrial Control System (ICS) environments). PCTE enables realistic training with variable conditions to increase readiness and lethality of our Cyberspace Forces, while simplifying and automating the training management process.\n\nProgram Characteristics:\n\nIntegration: Integrate existing and future cyber training capabilities into the standard PCTE platform.\nEnvironment: Integrate Red, Blue, Gray, and Industrial Control System (ICS) environments.\nEvent Management: Software that rapidly facilitates the planning and execution of individual, team, and collective training.\nConnectivity: Provides compute, storage, and leverages existing transport to enable persistent and available training, assessment, and mission rehearsal capability.",

As part of their attacks, they often conduct extensive reconnaissance to discover vulnerabilities that can give them access and full control over critical systems. Some of these may even have the potential to threaten the safety of citizens and personnel inside targeted facilities.\n\nOften we find vendors using proprietary protocols to communicate on our networks. Naturally, these protocols are harder to understand and protect due to a lack of publicly available information. As a result, sophisticated attackers are taking the time to analyze these protocols for vulnerabilities as they too often go unprotected by organizations.\n\nIn this webinar, Douglas McKee and Ismael Valenzuela, using their combined 30 years of experience in cybersecurity, will walk through how an adversary can dissect and understand proprietary protocols on your network to find vulnerabilities or leak sensitive information. These same techniques can be used by red teamers as well as blue teamers, to emulate behaviors and anticipate the adversary. We will provide insights using real data embedded into proprietary networking protocols used by vendors and the techniques needed to breakdown and understand this information.",

With over 25 courses in total, spanning topics ranging from introductory penetration testing and hardware hacking, all the way to advanced exploit writing and advanced red teaming, it made sense to identify a name that encompasses all of the underlying offensive-oriented courses and topic areas. Thus, Offensive Operations was born. The courses within the curriculum are now broken up into focus areas including penetration testing, red teaming, purple teaming, and exploit development.\n\nIn this webcast, Stephen Sims elaborates on these updates and speaks about the 9 exciting new courses we have in development.\n\nSpeaker Bio\nStephen Sims is an industry expert with over 15 years of experience in information technology and security. Stephen currently works out of San Francisco as a consultant. He has spent many years performing security architecture, exploit development, reverse engineering, and penetration testing. Stephen has an MS in information assurance from Norwich University and is a course author and senior instructor for the SANS Institute. He is the author of SANS' only 700-level course, SEC760: Advanced Exploit Development for Penetration Testers, which concentrates on complex heap overflows, patch diffing, and client-side exploits. Stephen is also the lead author on SEC660: Advanced Penetration Testing, Exploits, and Ethical Hacking and co-author of SEC599: Defeating Advanced Adversaries – Purple Team Tactics & Kill Chain Defenses. He holds the GIAC Security Expert (GSE) certification as well as the CISSP, CISA, Immunity NOP, and many other certifications. In his spare time, Stephen enjoys snowboarding and writing music.",

Unfortunately, as we have seen countless times in the past, when you pit static technology against a creative, determined human being, the human always wins. Fortunately, there is an answer; cyber deception. Cyber deception targets the human that is the attacker, creating a situation where they are unknowingly influenced to take actions advantageous to defenders. If they become aware of the deception, they are then forced to question every aspect of their interaction with their target ultimately slowing them down. Best of all, attackers don't need to fall victim to every deceptive tactic. All it takes is for the attacker to stumble across a single deceptive resource and they are caught. It is often said that defenders must be right 100% of the time while attackers need to be right once.\n\nCyber deception flips that paradigm on its head by creating a situation where attackers must be right 100% of the time while defenders must be right just once. If implemented effectively, cyber deception creates a scenario where it is easier for an attacker to physically break in to a facility to affect compromise than to break in \"over the wire\" without getting caught. In the past, attackers had many advantages over defenders. From simple netcat listeners and fake credentials to deceptive web sites and fake social networking content, in this talk, you will learn the fundamentals, directly from new SANS course SEC550: Cyber Deception - Attack Detection, Disruption and Active Defense, of how cyber deception can allow defenders to truly take back the advantage!",

You will create a loader with basic functionality then keep expanding upon it for multiple iterations. In the end, you will have learned how to create a full-fledged loader that can fetch and load multiple programs, handle unexpected error 404’s and more!\n\nPrerequisites: Having a bit of coding experience is recommended, however, you do not need specific knowledge of C#. We will go step by step and explain each and every step so it is easily understood.\n\nPrior to the workshop, please download and install Lab 0.\nWorkshop gitbook https://jfmaes-1.gitbook.io/reflection-workshop/\n\nSystem Requirements: You will need access to a computer with dotnetframework and visualstudio 2019 installed.",

          "description": "AWS and Azure cloud environments are the most widely used so naturally more research, tools, examples, and presentations have focused on these environments. However, what if your team (or you) need to assess a GCP environment? GCP documentation on using the environment isn't very intuitive. Therefore, when targeting a GCP environment for a red team engagement, it can prove very costly in terms of ramp up time, and the finished assessment can lack important insights and details. In this talk, we will address these problems by providing a detailed guide and examples on how to navigate Adversary Simulations through GCP. We will cover how to get an initial foothold, map to important objects, identify juicy permissions and leverage compromised account(s) to quickly zero in on critical targets with those permissions. GCP has thousands of IAM permissions and while this can be a daunting time waster, we don't need to learn about them all. We only need a small subset to achieve our objective. We will also demonstrate different methods that can be used to persist in GCP in a stealthy manner by abusing various resources. Based on how GCP is configured, a red teamer can run into issues with traditional C2 tools. In this scenario, we will show how you can successfully use Google's own products as Command & Control to bypass otherwise restricted C2 call backs. Next, we will show how to identify and leverage firewall rules of interest, as well as, the compute instances they are applied to and how to manipulate them when you don't find the firewall rules for the desired access. In closing, we will show how Cloud Key Management Service ( KMS ) integration works with Google Cloud Storage ( GCS ), as well as how to abuse it to decrypt and exfiltrate target data.\n\nPresenter: Madhav Bhatt, Offensive Security Engineer, Credit Karma\nhttps://www.sans.org/profiles/madhav-bhatt/\nPresenter: Brad Richardson, Credit Karma\nhttps://www.sans.org/profiles/brad-richardson/\n\nView upcoming Summits: http://www.sans.org/u/DuS\nDownload the presentation slides (SANS account required) at https://www.sans.org/u/1iaE",

Beginning with a bridge operation scenario we planned our approach on implementing the ICS Firing Range addressing all levels of the Purdue Model, from enterprise to physical processes. We were faced with a variety of practical challenges and challenges specific to the ICS context and prototyping: we learned how to implement ladder logic, how CAD modelling works, how to print 3D models with a 3D printer and how to combine all ICS and bridge components into a single, confined and mobile lab environment.

Lastly, we designed a series of kill chains for our firing range that we use for trainings on a variety of professions such as digital forensics and incident response.\n\nPresenter: Jeroen Vandeleur, Service Line Lead, NVISO\nhttps://www.sans.org/profiles/jeroen-vandeleur/\nPresenter: Moritz Thomas, Security Consultant, NVISO\nhttps://www.sans.org/profiles/moritz-thomas/\n\nView upcoming Summits: http://www.sans.org/u/DuS\nDownload the presentation slides (SANS account required) at https://www.sans.org/u/1iaE",

Every organization is creating and publishing its own APIs, even banks and e-commerce sites. They are developed when organizations want to share their services without exposing sensitive information like their database structure. But what about the security of those services? Are they well protected? Even RSAC, one of the most significant information security conferences globally, had an API vulnerability in their mobile app that leaked some user's first and last names in 2018. In this talk, we'll show a few basic steps that you can take today to start looking for vulnerabilities in APIs. From the level of exposure to information sensitivity going through the ability to change data, you can check and look for different things when testing an API. We'll demonstrate some not-so-standard tools for testing APIs and some common vulnerabilities you can find by using them.\n\nPresenter: Magno Logan, Information Security Specialist, Trend Micro\nhttps://www.sans.org/profiles/magno-logan/\n\nView upcoming Summits: http://www.sans.org/u/DuS\nDownload the presentation slides (SANS account required) at https://www.sans.org/u/1iaE",

I’ll also talk about how we parameter UI components synchronically on all platforms with the help of design tokens, and how this simplifies the structure of UI modules on a scale of several applications. I am going to share the difficulties we encountered during the UI scaling process and how this approach has significantly improved our quality of development.\nI am also going to talk about:\n\ndesign tokens, what they are needed for, how we implement them and how they help us support design in respect of synchronisation\nAbout our Remote Icons Pipeline, how we parse icons from the sketch file in a synchronised manner on all platforms\nHow tokens and the Remove Icons Pipeline have assisted us all-round as we have made a global a/b test for redesign\nAnd how this is scaled for all the company’s applications to scale development speed. We have a single MVIcore architecture, and this seamlessly leads to the emergence of a single approach to UI development. I will tell you about the architecture of UI modules and how it allows us to share UI between applications almost for free.\nAnd, of course, I will tell you about the problems we encountered at each stage\nWe decided to develop a single design system, Cosmos, which would simplify the interaction between designers and developers.

          "description": "Palestra ministrada pelo Prof.Dr. Aldo von Wangenheim (Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Florianópolis, Brasil) no III Ciclo de Seminários de Tecnologias de Informação em Saúde, organizado pela Diretoria de Educação e Capacitação Profissional da Sociedade Brasileira de Informática em Saúde (SBIS), em agosto de 2012.\n\nResumo da palestra:\n\nConvergência digital (CD) é o fenômeno em que diferentes funcionalidades convergem para seu uso um único dispositivo. Um smartphone moderno, por exemplo, é um dispositivo que congrega diferentes funções de comunicação, entretenimento e computação, permitindo mensagens instantânes, email, visualização de filmes, fotografia, filmagem, videoconferência e, claro, também serve para telefonar. O desafio da CD não é mais o de se produzir plataformas convergentes, mas sim sistematizar e tornar eficiente o processo de concepção e produção de aplicações e conteúdo multidispositivo. Assim, é necessário criar-se orientações/diretrizes de usabilidade para o desenvolvimento de sistemas de software multi-dispositivo considerando várias formas inovadoras de interação. Atualmente estamos ainda no período de inovação, em um cenário crescente de dispositivos digitais (iPads, telefones celulares, TV digital interativa, etc.). A CD já está demonstrando um enorme impacto no setor saúde, através de aplicativos e utilizações específicas. Nesta palestra falaremos sobre como isto está ocorrendo e as perspectivas da CD para o futuro.\n\nCurrículo do palestrante:\n\nProf. Dr. Aldo von Wangenheim\n\nPossui graduação em Ciências da Computação pela Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina (1989) e Doutorado Acadêmico (Dr. rer.nat.) em Ciências da Computação pela Universidade de Kaiserslautern (1996).

Muitas destas novas técnicas encontram-se interligadas causando alguma dificuldade em distinguir os diferentes conceitos de computação, informática, telecomunicação, tecnologia de informação e novas tecnologias. Os desdobramentos da aplicação destas diversas técnicas no cenário médico resultam em um vasto conjunto de possibilidades englobadas de forma genérica na especialidade de Informática Médica. Ainda que limitado, incluímos freqüentemente neste termo todas as novas tecnologias aplicadas a Medicina, voltadas para a produção de estruturas de representação de dados e de conhecimentos. A busca de um melhor entendimento nos processos e nos relacionamentos complexos, visando o desenvolvimento de métodos de aquisição e de representação de dados, evitam a sobrecarga de informações, além de gerenciar as mudanças necessárias nos usuários, nos processos e nas tecnologias empregadas, otimizando o uso de informações, e promovendo a integração de processos de modo a oferecer a melhor performance para cada cenário. Uma atitude mais racional é a de entender o potencial das novas tecnologias à luz do conhecimento de suas qualidades e limitações. A Medicina é uma das atividades mais tradicionais e conservadoras de toda sociedade. Esta postura pode retardar alguns processos mas resulta numa filtragem de novas tecnologias que fracassaram ao serem implantadas em setores onde a incorporação tecnológica é costumeiramente mais rápida.\n\nCurrículo do Palestrante\n\nDr. Marivan Santiago Abrahão\n\nClínico Geral e Nefrologista.

Prof.Dr. Lincoln de Assis Moura Jr, diretor de relações internacionais da SBIS, tesoureiro e presidente eleito da IMIA.\n\nResumo da palestra:\n\nA IMIA é a Associação Internacional de Infomática Médica (www.imia.org). Ela nasceu há 40 anos e naquele tempo o conceito de Informática em Saúde era poderoso como é hoje. No entanto, a IMIA cobre tudo o que hoje se chama de Informática em Saúde, Informática BioMédica ou mesmo eHealth. A IMIA congrega sociedades centíficas, empresas, organzações acadêmicas e mesmo indivíduos de mais de 85 países. O grande objetivo, e o grande dilema da IMIA, são muito parecidos com os objetivos e os dilemas da própria SBIS, o que é de se esperar, já que a IMIA é uma Federação de sociedades como a SBIS. Assim como a SBIS é vista com respeito e isenção no Brasil e pela comunidade internacional que nos conhece, a IMIA tem a excelente condição de representar conhecimento e isenção perante toda a comunidade internacional. Ao contrário do HL7 e do HIMSS que mesmo sendo internacionais são organizações de origem norte-americana e percebidos como tal, a IMIA tende a representar países. Isto torna a IMIA especial. O grande e inequívoco evento organizado pela IMIA é o Medinfo, mais uma identificação clara com o que acontence na SBIS, em relação ao CBIS. Nesta apresentação, iremos apresentar um pouco da história da IMIA, mostrar a sua organização em Grupos de Trabalho, falar das suas Regiões, das suas lideranças passadas e atuais, conversar sobre os desafios e omplanejamento estartégico que a IMIA persegue hoje, e, finalmente, conversar sobre o papel que nós brasileiros podemos ter nesta tão importante organização.\n\nCurrículo do palestrante:\n\nDr. Lincoln de Assis Moura Jr.\nEngenheiro Eletricista, modalidade Eletrônica, pela EESC-USP (1976), MSc em Engenharia Biomédica pelo Programa de Engenharia Biomédica da COPPE/UFRJ (1979) e PhD pelo Imperial College, Londres (1988).

Profa.Dr. Magdala de Araújo Novaes, coordenadora do Núcleo de Tecnologias em Saúde (NUTES), RUTE-UFPE e Programa de Telessaúde Brasil em Pernambuco.\n\nResumo da palestra:\n\nO uso da telessaúde ou telemedicina nos serviços públicos de saúde vem crescendo a cada ano no Brasil. Em outros países não é diferente, a prática da telessaúde tem ampliado a oferta de saúde a comunidades isoladas ou desprovidas de serviços especializados. O suporte remoto as equipes que atuam na Estratégia de Saúde da Família no Brasil tem sido fundamental para melhorar a resolubilidade destas equipes, diminuir deslocamentos de pacientes e profissionais na rede e custos no sistema público de saúde. Mas o que é telessaúde? uma tecnologia ou um serviço? Vamos explorar as diferentes modalidades desta prática, seus recursos e principais atores, e estratégias adotadas para implantação da telessaúde na atenção primária no Brasil. O Programa Telessaúde Brasil será utilizado para exemplificar os diferentes cenários de uso. Discutir os diferentes impactos da prática da telessaúde pode ajudar a melhor desenvolver sua estratégia local de utilização para uma boa relação custo efetividade, além de entender seus limites e benefícios para o sistema de saúde como um todo.\n\nCurrículo do palestrante:\n\nProfa.Dra.Magdala de Araújo Novaes\nDoutora em Bioinformática pela Université D´Aix-Marseille II (França), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique em 1993, especializada em informática aplicada às organizações pela Université de Montpellier I (França), e graduada em Ciência da Computação pela Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE) em 1987 (Brasil).

Profa.Dr. Magdala de Araújo Novaes, coordenadora do Núcleo de Tecnologias em Saúde (NUTES), RUTE-UFPE e Programa de Telessaúde Brasil em Pernambuco.\n\nResumo da palestra:\n\nO uso da telessaúde ou telemedicina nos serviços públicos de saúde vem crescendo a cada ano no Brasil. Em outros países não é diferente, a prática da telessaúde tem ampliado a oferta de saúde a comunidades isoladas ou desprovidas de serviços especializados. O suporte remoto as equipes que atuam na Estratégia de Saúde da Família no Brasil tem sido fundamental para melhorar a resolubilidade destas equipes, diminuir deslocamentos de pacientes e profissionais na rede e custos no sistema público de saúde. Mas o que é telessaúde? uma tecnologia ou um serviço? Vamos explorar as diferentes modalidades desta prática, seus recursos e principais atores, e estratégias adotadas para implantação da telessaúde na atenção primária no Brasil. O Programa Telessaúde Brasil será utilizado para exemplificar os diferentes cenários de uso. Discutir os diferentes impactos da prática da telessaúde pode ajudar a melhor desenvolver sua estratégia local de utilização para uma boa relação custo efetividade, além de entender seus limites e benefícios para o sistema de saúde como um todo.\n\nCurrículo do palestrante:\n\nProfa.Dra.Magdala de Araújo Novaes\nDoutora em Bioinformática pela Université D´Aix-Marseille II (França), Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique em 1993, especializada em informática aplicada às organizações pela Université de Montpellier I (França), e graduada em Ciência da Computação pela Universidade Federal de Pernambuco (UFPE) em 1987 (Brasil).

In the beginning, their kung fu was based mostly on everyday activities such as hunting animals, climbing trees, plowing land, and rowing boats. At the same time, they observed how certain animals hunted their prey and then imitated their postures and movements. Not surprisingly, they did not neglect the cat, a skilled hunter and a familiar household animal to them.\r\n\r\nTo the ancient people, cats were an extremely smart and faithful animal that were loved and treated as a friend in the family. Their effective hunting skills and special fighting style gave ancient Vietnamese an idea about developing a style of fighting that captures the cat's strengths -- quick attack, quiet retreat, sharp observation, high jumping, fast running, effortless movements and extremely nimble postures.\r\n\r\nThe cat-like fighting style, existing in a preliminary form next to other animal-based forms of kung fu, such as the tigers, m!onkey!s, snakes, became a vital instrument for ancient Vietnamese to deal with dangers and challenges. Over time, the postures and movements of the cat were systematized and developed into a full-fledged form of martial arts.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the cat kung fu helped to diversify the many Vietnamese schools of fighting and enrich the national treasure of traditional martial arts.",

The report noted the Fed may pivot to cutting borrowing costs by 2023.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Binance and FTX are extending their reach during the continued market rout, with Binance’s spot-trading market share sitting at 49.7% as of June, up from 45% in January, according to CryptoCompare data.</p>\n<p>The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-and-ftx-big-crypto-exchanges-get-bigger-11659099865?mod=lead_feature_below_a_pos1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> Friday that FTX saw its market share hitting 8.95% in June, up from 6% in January, as the company has been aggressive in marketing and acquisitions.</p>\n<p>In other news, former Voyager Digital executive Shingo Lavine has been considering a competing restructuring plan, which would cut out existing management and take the platform away from its lending business, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-29/former-voyager-executive-toys-with-competing-restructuring-plan?srnd=premium&amp;sref=zNmRQ0gk#xj4y7vzkg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote</a> Friday.</p>\n<p>Lavine, along with his father and another Voyager shareholder, were looking at the broad strokes of the proposal in a recent bankruptcy court filing.</p>\n<p>Lavine left Voyager in early 2021 due to disagreements over the direction of the company. His version of the company doesn’t lend crypto and is focused more on digital asset trading and customer security, and lawyers for Lavine said Voyager hasn’t been amenable to the proposal thus far.</p>\n<p>As that’s happening, ether might be making surprising gains that could see it gaining on bitcoin as the top cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>That has seen fans saying it might take the throne someday soon, per a Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-31/-wen-flippening-crypto-fans-wager-on-ether-surpassing-bitcoin?srnd=premium&amp;sref=zNmRQ0gk#xj4y7vzkg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report</a> Sunday (July 31). Crypto slang has it known as the “flippening,” which is still a ways off if it’ll ever happen — the market value of the coin is still less than half the size of bitcoin’s.</p>\n<p>In further crypto news, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-30/crypto-investors-nursing-bitcoin-btc-losses-have-family-friends-to-thank?srnd=premium&amp;sref=zNmRQ0gk#xj4y7vzkg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wrote</a> Saturday (July 30) that many recent crypto crash victims can cite the influence of family or friends as reasons why they got into their current situation.</p>\n<p>The report noted that crypto lost around $2 trillion in market value since bitcoin was at a high last November. A survey by the U.K. financial regulator from October said three quarters of investors under 40 cited competition with people they knew as a big reason they put money into crypto.</p>\n<p>Finally, a new stablecoin lending project on the Binance Smart Chain Network, SMARTLend, will help investors get more financial and time freedom, according to a <a href=\"https://cryptonews.com/news/smartlendfinance-secure-and-audited-stablecoin-lending-platform-on-binance-smart-chain.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report</a> from CryptoNews.</p>\n<p>SMARTLend, as a ROI decentralized application (DApp), will come with features allowing participants to stake any amount above 5 BUSD, USDT, USDC or DAI, and they can withdraw the profit without any fee.

Issuers all over the map have said they’re allocating more for marketing spending, per the report.</p>\n<p>J.P. Morgan Chase, the biggest U.S. card issuer, showed how fierce the competition has been for borrowers recently, blaming higher customer acquisition costs for a 45% fall in second-quarter card profits.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Capital One, the second-largest U.S. issuer, said its quarterly marketing expenses were up 62% from the same time last year. The bank said it would keep being aggressive.</p>\n<p>This increase in activity is “noteworthy” because of how the economy is doing, per the report, as lenders usually sending out fewer card offers when things are looking uncertain. Usually at those times, there’s also a greater focus on selling premium cards and making offers to existing customers.</p>\n<p>But now, lenders think they have room to bolster the size of their loan books, with low unemployment and apparently healthy consumer balance sheets.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is still raising interest rates to help bring down inflation.

In May, a <a href=\"https://www.simon-kucher.com/sites/default/files/WP_Neo-Banking_A4_Digital_CBU.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report</a> by Simon Kucher and Partners estimated that less than 5% of neobanks globally had achieved break-even.</p>\n<p>But no business can burn through venture capital forever.

This can make it difficult to gauge exactly how well they are performing in terms of revenue and profit.</p>\n<p>Starling on one hand appears to be in good financial shape. The last time the challenger bank <a href=\"https://www.starlingbank.com/news/starling-bank-revenue-rises-600-percent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">published </a>information about its earnings in July 2021, they reported a nearly 600% jump in revenue between November 2020 to March 2021 to £97.6 million, with a nearly 50% drop in losses after tax from £23.3 million to £52.1 million.</p>\n<p><strong>Related news:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/pymnts-post/earnings/2021/uk-fintech-starling-bank-sees-revenues-soar-600-pct/?c=news/page/Page/page/929\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UK FinTech Starling Bank Sees Revenues Soar 600 Pct</a></p>\n<p><strong>Read also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/news/banking/2022/uk-fintech-starling-scuttles-eu-banking-license/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UK FinTech Starling Scuttles EU Banking License</a></p>\n<p>Earlier in April, Zopa CEO Jaidev Janardana told attendees at the Innovate Global Finance Summit that the company had achieved profitability within just 21 months of attaining its U.K. banking license.</p>\n<p>“Today’s news makes Zopa one of the fastest digital banks to achieve profitability ever and reinforces our thesis on the importance of sustainable growth as a catalyst for accelerated product and market expansion,” he said.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch Jaidev Janardana interview:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/buy-now-pay-later/2022/whats-next-in-bnpl-zopa-ceo-says-longer-terms-larger-loans/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">What’s Next in BNPL: Zopa CEO Says Longer Terms, Larger Loans</a></p>\n<p>As for Revolut, it most recently published details of its earnings for the year 2020 reveal a 215% yearly increase in gross profits to £123 million, and steadily declining operating losses from £55 million in the first quarter of 2020 to just £6 million in Q4 that same year.</p>\n<p>To date, however, the FinTech, valued at $33 billion last year, has not prioritized profitability or highlighted it in its corporate rhetoric as much as Starling and Zopa have done. Instead, Revolut has aggressively expanded beyond the U.K. market — it accounts for 25% of its overall income — using the $1.7 billion it has raised in funding to grow a significant footprint in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia.</p>\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2022/revolut-turns-7-with-20m-customers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Revolut Turns 7 with 20M Customers</a></p>\n<p>Internationally, Revolut has also launched in Australia, Japan and the U.S. following partnerships with local banks that allow it to operate under their licenses, and it is due to launch in India soon.</p>\n<p><strong>Read on:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/digital-payments/2022/revolut-turns-7-with-20m-customers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Revolut Turns 7 with 20M Customers</a></p>\n<p>In the case of Monzo, the company’s 2021 annual <a href=\"https://monzo.com/annual-report/2021/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">report</a> shows that losses were just shy of £130 million in the 2020-21 financial year, up from £114 million the previous year.

And as the $800 million it managed to raise at its last fundraising round demonstrates, investors certainly believe that a high customer count will ultimately translate into profit.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>For all PYMNTS EMEA coverage, subscribe to the daily </em><a href=\"https://pymnts.com/subscribe/\"><em>EMEA Newsletter</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n",

Restaurants and travel are easier to reign in (indeed we’re seeing this already in the fact that a majority of consumers will cut back on retail.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But if, overall, 49% of us are dipping into savings to cover everyday expenses — as we have found — then it stands to reason that savings are being used to keep alive, so to speak. As inflation continues to rise, and purchasing power continues to decline, we’re not running in place. We’re falling behind.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The savings cushion can last only so long. <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/consumer-finance/2022/savings-cushion-dwindles-for-lower-income-paycheck-to-paycheck-economy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">In earlier research this year</a>, back in May, we found that for paycheck-to-paycheck consumers who have issues paying the bills, the most recent savings measures are on the downtrend. The average savings account here has $2,464, down from a peak of more than $4,000 at the peak, cushioned in part by stimulus checks sent out during the pandemic.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The percentage of pressured P2P respondents that would not be able to afford a $400 emergency expense translates to 42% of P2P consumers who have issues paying the bills, up from 40% less than a year ago. The cash on hand that they’ve traditionally used to fund these same expenses has not been enough.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Something’s got to give, as the old song goes. And the “give” will be “given” at merchants’ top lines, as consumers do what they can to staunch the bleeding at least a bit.</p>\n",

Yes, the digital advertising market is seeing competition. But the steep drop, and the tens of billions of dollars in lost market cap that Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-21/meta-alphabet-knocked-down-after-snap-s-awful-results\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimated</a> had been seen in sympathy across platforms speaks to something larger.</p>\n<p>The key is that Apple has changed its privacy policies, and as a result, users can deny permission to be tracked.</p>\n<p><strong>Platform Policy Changes</strong></p>\n<p>Indeed, as management noted in the Snap <a href=\"https://s25.q4cdn.com/442043304/files/doc_financials/2022/q2/Snap-Inc.-Q2-2022-Investor-Letter-vF.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">investor letter</a> released Thursday after the market closed, “platform policy changes have upended more than a decade of advertising industry standards, and macroeconomic challenges have disrupted many of the industry segments that have been most critical to the growing demand for our advertising solutions. We are also seeing increasing competition for advertising dollars that are now growing more slowly.”</p>\n<p>And during the question-and-answer session with analysts, Snap Chief Financial Officer <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/derekandersen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Derek Andersen</a> said “the deceleration began with the platform policy changes implemented in Q3 of last year.” The changes are impacting the traditional models that are “used to drive the direct response to advertising business, as well as the tools used to measure the returns from that direct response advertising.”</p>\n<p>Last year, Apple introduced its App Tracking Transparency system that lets users have the choice as to whether third-party apps can track them. The changes wrought to the iOS have helped to disrupt at least some of the activity seen with Snap’s advertising partners.</p>\n<p><b>See more: </b><a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2021/data-privacy-day-apple-ad-tracking-changes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Data Privacy Day Coincides With Apple's Ad Tracking Changes</a></p>\n<p>Making it harder for advertisers to target users means they might pull back ad spending in a hugely inflationary environment such as the one we’re seeing today. Indeed, management said on the most recent Snap call that advertisers’ budgets and bids have been trending lower.</p>\n<p>Snap, for its part, has been trying to monetize its model in different ways, with a nod to its direct response business, including first- and third-party measurement solutions. The company also is striving to improve ranking and optimization.</p>\n<p>But it will take time, as the Andersen said, because “in terms of monetization, we face a number of very large and very sophisticated competitors. So today, we’re seeing the overall advertising pie grow at a slower rate.”</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Apple is in the midst of restructuring its services to amp up its presence in advertising.</p>\n<p><b>Read more:</b> <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/apple/2022/apple-may-revamp-services-to-focus-on-streaming-ads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apple May Revamp Services to Focus on Streaming, Ads</a></p>\n<p>The headwinds grow, and for the platforms, the “Apple problem” grows too.</p>\n",

As space exploration advances more quickly than ever before, we are thrilled to work with SpaceX and help spark limitless play patterns for the space explorer in every kid.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">No stranger to merchandising — the <a href=\"https://shop.spacex.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SpaceX Shop</a> is loaded with backpacks, caps, Martian coffee mugs and our favorite, the Unisex Starship Pullover — SpaceX Vice President <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/brianbjelde/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brian Bjelde</a> said, “At SpaceX, we believe that a future in which humanity is out among the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one in which we are not. We look forward to working with Mattel to help inspire the next generation of space explorers and enthusiasts.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new SpaceX toy line is being produced by Mattel’s <a href=\"https://shop.mattel.com/collections/matchbox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Matchbox</a> brand, which makes sense given its experience with toys for aspiring pilots and astronauts including the Hot Wheels® Mario Kart<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> Gliders Assortment, and the Disney Pixar Lightyear Hot Wheels R/C Spaceship, which is right in the SpaceX sweet spot.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you seen that Hot Wheels R/C Spaceship? Makes the SpaceX Dragon look like your grandfather’s Oldsmobile. Plus, it has a Buzz Lightyear action figure. Where do we sign?</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Astro-Nuts</strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There was, in fact, no news about Barbie in the SpaceX-Mattel <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220720005304/en/Mattel-Announces-Multi-Year-Agreement-with-SpaceX-to-Produce-Toys-and-Collectibles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announcement</a> but she’s been to space a few times before. Actual space. The real thing. And quite recently, too.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As Mashable reported, “Two Barbies blasted off on a Northrop Grumman Cygnus spaceflight from Wallops Island, Virginia, on Feb. 19. Now they’re residents of the International Space Station, marking the first time in Barbie history that the doll has literally traveled to outer space.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Literally” being the operative word there. Barbie first donned a spacesuit in 1965, and there’s been a steady stream of “Astronaut Barbie” updates since. A quick web search finds everyone from Amazon to Target to Walmart having no supply chain issues with space Barbies.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://creations.mattel.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Mattel Creations</a>, a direct-to-consumer “collector platform that offers a canvas for the most innovative creators of today and tomorrow,” had the good sense to make a collectible <a href=\"https://creations.mattel.com/products/samantha-cristoforetti-barbie-doll-gtj81?variant=39893306409165&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=shopping&amp;utm_content=Samantha+Cristoforetti+Barbie+Doll&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIosvZ2IyN-QIVesmUCR0RWg22EAQYAyABEgKE2_D_BwE\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Samantha Cristoforetti Barbie Doll</a> last year. The real Samantha Cristoforetti is a member of the European Space Agency and has lots of actual space miles to her credit.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We do love that Mattel immortalized Samantha Cristoforetti, but for our money the real fun is the <a href=\"https://shop.mattel.com/products/barbie-space-discovery-doll-and-playset-gxf27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Barbie Space Discovery Space Station Playset</a>, which comes with NASA-approved (not really) accessories including Space Explorer Barbie (obviously), a workstation with all kinds of science equipment as well as — wait for it — her puppy and a puppy bed. Because no self-respecting Barbie goes to space without her Pomeranian.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The set also contains “astronaut food” — but we’re not making any assumptions.</p>\n",

There were plans to issue a $1 billion bitcoin-backed bond that would be used to build a “Bitcoin City” on a volcano, beginning with geothermal-powered bitcoin mining.

That was $34.2 million, bringing the 10-month total to $120.5 million according to the Central Reserve Bank, Bloomberg Linea <a href=\"https://www.bloomberglinea.com/2022/07/20/criptoremesas-en-el-salvador-rompen-la-marca-de-los-us100-millones/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> on July 20.</p>\n<p>That said, it’s still a drop in the bucket of about 1.9% of the total of $6.4 billion in remittances received by Salvadoran families.

          "content": "<p>A Citi analyst said on July 21 that the contagion from a depegged stablecoin spreading eight- and nine-figure losses through the crypto lending and exchange community appears to have run its course.</p>\n<p>Which will be cold comfort to the roughly 150 people crypto exchange Blockchain.com laid off that Thursday in the wake of the firm’s $270 million loss to Three Arrows Capital, a crypto hedge fund that had an estimated $10 billion in assets and made a number of very risky investments in decentralized finance (DeFi) projects including the Terra/LUNA algorithmic stablecoin project.</p>\n<p>TerraUSD shot from nowhere to the No. 3 position in stablecoins last year, with a market capitalization of $18 billion worth of dollar-pegged UST. But it maintained that peg through a complex arbitrage system with its free-floating sister token, LUNA, which was managed by self-executing smart contracts.</p>\n<p>On May 7, it lost its peg briefly — first by fractions of a penny and then by nearly 2 cents by May 9. Attempts to reassure investors failed and a run ensued. On May 10, it collapsed to $0.80, then on May 13 to $0.40. By the end of the month, it was under $0.03, and its market cap had fallen from $18 billion to $220 million.</p>\n<p>Three Arrows had invested heavily in LUNA, which at the beginning of May had a $29.5 billion market cap. At the end of the month that was $750 million.</p>\n<p>The hedge fund couldn’t repay its loans, leaving a number of crypto lending firms, which offered extremely high interest rates — some over 20% — to people who locked in cryptocurrency, in the lurch. They then leant it out to both small retail borrowers in overcollateralized loans and in large sums to institutional investors like Three Arrows — known as 3AC — seeking aggressive returns to cover the interest rates they were paying.</p>\n<p>“3AC was supposed to be the adult in the room,” said Nik Bhatia, a finance economics professor at the University of Southern California, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/11/how-the-fall-of-three-arrows-or-3ac-dragged-down-crypto-investors.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">told</a> CNBC. “Not only were they not hedging anything, but they also evaporated billions in creditors’ funds.”</p>\n<p>Bhatia, author of the 2021 book on digital currencies “Layered Money,” said that “the terraUSD and LUNA collapse is ground zero … [in a] long, nightmarish chain of leverage and fraud.”</p>\n<p><strong>Three Smaller Waves</strong></p>\n<p>While much of the damage flowed through Three Arrows, two other waves rippled out from terra/LUNA’s collapse — wiping out many small investors. It’s unlikely that the only bankruptcies of the $48 billion collapse were corporate.</p>\n<p>Separate from the Three Arrows debacle was crypto lender Celsius, which had invested heavily in a DeFi project that was indirectly but badly damaged by the terra/LUNA collapse.</p>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/stablecoin-collapse-sent-voyager-digital-and-celsius-on-different-paths-to-bankruptcy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stablecoin Collapse Sent Voyager Digital and Celsius on Different Paths to Bankruptcy</a></p>\n<p>It was the first to freeze customer funds but after a long struggle, it entered bankruptcy on July 13.

In the wake of the collapse and contagion, moves are afoot in Congress to pass a stablecoin regulation bill this year that would, among other things, mandate 100% backing reserves held in dollars or U.S. Treasuries.</p>\n<p>Read more: <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/reports-house-committee-close-to-vote-on-payments-stablecoin-bill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Reports: House Committee Close to Vote on ‘Payments Stablecoin’ Bill</a></p>\n<p>That’s despite acknowledgment that a broad crypto regulation act will not happen before 2023.</p>\n<p><strong>The Three Arrows' Ripple </strong></p>\n<p>In dribs and drabs, seven big lenders emerged over the next month, although Three Arrow’s bankruptcy liquidator named two dozen creditors, The Wall Street Journal <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/genesis-lent-2-4-billion-to-hedge-fund-three-arrows-capital-11658170583?mod=mktw&amp;adobe_mc=MCMID%3D08060102376363295660764077640276148122%7CMCORGID%3DCB68E4BA55144CAA0A4C98A5%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1658516004\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">said</a>.</p>\n<p>All in all, about $2.8 billion is owed by Three Arrows, Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-22/three-arrows-founders-en-route-to-dubai-describe-ltcm-moment?srnd=cryptocurrencies-v2#xj4y7vzkg\">reported</a>.</p>\n<p>By far the largest was Genesis Global Trading, owned by Digital Currency Group, which lost $2.4 billion. It owns several other prominent crypto companies, including news site CoinDesk and Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.</p>\n<p>Next was crypto lender Voyager Digital, with $687 million and BlockFi, which lost about $250 million. The former is in bankruptcy and the latter cut a deal that could see it acquired for a song by the FTX exchange. That could make FTX a long-term winner, even though it lost a relatively small sum to Three Arrows — as did derivatives exchange BitMEX.</p>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/another-firm-cuts-withdrawals-highlighting-crypto-lendings-dangers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Another Firm Cuts Withdrawals, Highlighting Crypto Lending’s Dangers</a></p>\n<p>Voyager has said that customers will likely not get all of their funds back but rather a grab bag including its own VGX tokens.</p>\n<p>Aside from Blockchain.com’s $270 million — and its cuts well beyond layoffs to include expansion projects and pulling out of Argentina — its derivatives exchange Derebit was also hit for $80 million. Exchange CoinList lost $35 million to Three Arrows, as did DeFinance Capital and lender Finblox limited withdrawals on June 17, CryptoSlate <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/three-arrows-capital-contagion-spills-over-to-crypto-saving-platform-finblox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Ripples on Ripples</strong></p>\n<p>There have been other dominos.

While load count was down for those reasons, revenue per load was up.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Labor challenges within the rail network appear to be softening, leading to improved notification times and more consistency for our customers,” Miller said.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Enhancing Utilization of Trailers </strong></p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking ahead, Knight-Swift expects to see rates slide late in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter as the spot market moderates, miles per tractor to improve modestly and logistics load volumes to increase while revenue per load decreases.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The company also expects sourcing and retaining drivers to improve, but remain challenging, and inflationary pressure to continue in most cost areas, including maintenance, equipment and non-driving labor.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To deal with the challenges, the company will continue to deploy technology.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Certainly, we have more technology to develop, but between our ability to connect our systems across brands, our enhanced visibility and utilization of trailers, and the actual insights our reporting capabilities provide our team, we are leveraging tech to successfully navigate the market, execute on our strategies and deliver on our relentless efforts to be the most productive and have the lowest operating cost in the industry,” Miller said.</p>\n",

Having the best cross-border payments strategy in place is also key to success.</p>\n<p>A perpetual headache from cross-border commerce is the high cost of processing international transactions.</p>\n<p>It’s exactly this frustration that drove eCommerce giant Amazon to threaten to suspend Visa payments in the U.K. last year after the card processor upped its cross-border transaction fees in the country following the lifting of a fee cap when the U.K. left the European Union.</p>\n<p>In the end, Amazon used the threat to renegotiate its agreement with Visa at the global level and U.K. consumers were never cut off from using their Visa cards on the Amazon marketplace. The new deal also worked in favor of Amazon’s customers in Australia and Singapore, who previously had to pay a surcharge when making payments with their Visa card.</p>\n<p>More recently, in June, the U.K.’s Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) launched its own inquiry into Visa and Mastercard's post-Brexit fee hike. And just this month, the Treasury Committee of the U.K.’s parliament has put significant political weight behind the PSR investigation by sending letters to Visa and Mastercard asking them to explain their increased fees.</p>\n<p><strong>See also: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/credit-cards/2022/uk-regulator-to-review-visa-mastercards-processing-and-swipe-fees/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UK Regulator to Review Visa, Mastercard’s Processing and Swipe Fees</a></p>\n<p>In the end, what forces international payment networks to lower their cross-border fees may not be regulatory pressure but rather market forces.</p>\n<p>In recent years, FinTechs that propose innovative solutions to the cross-border problem have been one of the industry's greatest success stories. And while many of these initially focused on peer-to-peer payments, the focus has increasingly shifted to retail payments.</p>\n<p>For example, international money transfer app Wise started out as a multicurrency account for individuals but the company now has a dedicated eCommerce account designed to help international retailers reduce the cost of processing incoming payments.</p>\n<p><strong>Leveling the Playing Field</strong></p>\n<p>Compared to the rapid growth in innovative payment and remittance solutions for consumers in other parts of the world, businesses across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region still lack access to affordable payment and money transfer opportunities.</p>\n<p>In a region where the eCommerce sector is still relatively young compared to more mature markets in Europe, America, and China, expensive cross-border fees can hurt merchants' growth prospects.</p>\n<p>“We’ve seen consumers and businesses becoming really tired of paying expensive payment charges to transfer money globally, often taking one to five business days to complete,” Kaushik Sthankiya, chief commercial officer at global payments provider Sokin, told PYMNTS in a recent interview.</p>\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/financial-inclusion-3/2022/startups-opt-for-fixed-price-payments-to-bank-menas-unbanked/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Startups Opt for Fixed-Price Payments to Bank MENA’s Unbanked</a></p>\n<p>In the end, FinTechs like Sokin are stepping up to meet the demands of businesses for cheaper cross-border fees and access to more international markets. These days, wherever an eCommerce business wants to sell, there’s likely a payment solution that will help them connect with their customers in that place.</p>\n<p>Not all online retailers have the same bargaining chips as a giant like Amazon would, but what they do have is the ability to choose the solution that works best for them.</p>\n<p>So, as the payment gateway and processing options available to eCommerce businesses in the MENA region grow, it seems likely that prices will come down too.</p>\n<p><em>For all PYMNTS EMEA coverage, subscribe to the daily </em><a href=\"https://pymnts.com/subscribe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>EMEA Newsletter</em></a><em>.</em></p>\n",

The Blockchain That Moved Crypto Beyond Currency</a></p>\n<p>Now to be sure, it’s not an apples-to-apples comparison, or even apples to oranges. Even cryptocurrencies with strong development foundations are still decentralized projects with big goals but serious credibility problems ranging from inability to scale to huge hacks and collapses — and that’s before the increasingly hostile regulatory vacuum that politicians and regulators are filling.</p>\n<p>But both industries do have one thing in common: They are in the business of payments. For all the talk of bitcoin as an investment token as opposed to a payments currency — its creator’s intended use was peer-to-peer payments without a trusted third party — virtually all cryptocurrencies on all blockchains are tools for settling transactions.</p>\n<p><strong>Payments Pain</strong></p>\n<p>To an extent, both payments firms and cryptocurrencies have had the same overarching problem in the past 12 months — specifically, a rising sense that the end of a long bull market that even survived several years of pandemic-induced disruption is in its dying days and a deep recession is coming. And a big sell-off in tech stocks generally isn’t helping.</p>\n<p>For payments players, the huge haircuts in valuation over the last six months is a puzzle, since for many, valuations that are now more or less at pre-COVID levels imply that the digital tailwinds were temporary. An analysis using revised Census data shows how wrong that way of thinking is.</p>\n<p><strong>See also:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/news/ecommerce/2022/revised-census-data-shows-ecommerce-share-didnt-plummet-after-all/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Revised Census Data Shows eCommerce Share Didn’t Plummet After All</a></p>\n<p>Although consumers may be cutting back, the price they are paying for goods and services continues to rise, which boosts transaction volumes. The boost in June retail sales was more about the impact of inflation on prices, rather than consumers buying more things.</p>\n<p><strong>Crypto Conundrum</strong></p>\n<p>The thing about crypto’s price collapse is that it’s a lot easier to understand. Without exuberance, a product whose core value proposition is at best years off is a harder sell in a downturn.</p>\n<p>That’s the thing. While actual uses for blockchain are growing, and there are signs big finance is adopting decentralized finance’s (DeFi’s) tools, there really isn’t a lot there yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/cryptocurrency/2022/crypto-basics-series-the-tokenomics-of-crypto/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Crypto Basics Series: The Tokenomics of Crypto</a></p>\n<p>DeFi, as Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler noted last week, sees 95% of its activity plowed into other DeFi projects, to the point that it’s close to a closed system, despite signs that things like crypto lending are moving out into the real world.</p>\n<p>And the real underlying business case for almost all cryptocurrencies is that as their blockchains grow more and more successful, there will be more and more calls for a deliberately finite number of tokens required for any use or transaction. Which is nice, but with as many as 10,000 blockchains out there, there’s a lot of competition — even if tokens’ maximum caps didn’t tend to be numbered in the billions or trillions.</p>\n<p>While Ethereum gets a lot of use and more than a few real businesses are up and running on other blockchains — Ripple’s cross-border payments network, for example — those blockchains are not in jeopardy of seeing tokens under-supplied for transaction use anytime soon.</p>\n<p><em>For all PYMNTS Crypto coverage, subscribe to the daily </em><a href=\"https://www.pymnts.com/subscribe/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><em>Crypto Newsletter</em></a>.</p>\n",

          "content": "<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It only comes around once a year — National Ice Cream Day — it’s being celebrated on Sunday (July 17), and by happy coincidence, it aligns this year with the 100th anniversary of an iconic frozen treat, the Klondike Bar.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As if anyone needs an excuse to celebrate either.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those taking a dim view of 2022, this may lend some perspective into what’s bad and what’s worse. Sure, everybody’s saying there’s going to be a recession in 2022. That’s bad. On some level worse is the fact that Klondike Bars were sold only in Pennsylvania and Ohio … until 1978.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That’s cold, even hard to grasp, but so says <a href=\"https://www.unileverusa.com/brands/ice-cream/klondike/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Unilever</a>, which acquired the maker of these yummy chocolate-dipped slabs of ice cream in 1993, placing it into the Good Humor-Breyers portfolio of frigid delights. Sensing the moment, Unilever said, “This acquisition put Americans of every age within reach of the most comprehensive line of chilly treats in dessert history.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If really you want to thank someone, we refer you to the late visionary businessman Henry DeBrunner Clarke Jr., whose firm Clabir made its real money in defense contracts. He bought the rights to Klondike Bar in 1976, adding it to his food holdings — and possibly for military applications — reportedly bringing sales of the dessert from $800,000 annually at the time of the acquisition by Clabir to more than $60 million when he sold it in 1989.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the most recent sales figures we can find, IRI data from 2019 said U.S. sales were over $309 million that year. That was also the year actress Anna Farris was the face of a Klondike campaign that dared people to legally change their name for a lifetime supply of said treat.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Confronted with the question herself, there’s not much Farris won’t do for a K-Bar. See it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZSxz-vcbR8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back to Clarke, who signed a noncompete when he sold, but only covering the U.S. That takes us down the rabbit hole of his later exploits in the U.K. and Europe, going lick-to-lick against archrival Häagen-Daz. But that’s a cool story for another National Ice Cream Day.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one’s for the 100-year-old Klondike Bar, which incidentally was not conceived as a treat for children. Inventor and dairy owner Henry Isaly believed sticks were for kids. “Isaly thought frozen treats with a wooden handle = kiddie,” Delish <a href=\"https://www.delish.com/food-news/g3530/things-you-should-know-before-eating-a-klondike-bar/#:~:text=It%20Was%20Designed%20to%20Be,a%20fancy%20silver%20foil%20wrapper.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a>. “He aimed for a more mature audience, so he removed it and packaged the bars in a fancy silver foil wrapper.”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And don’t forget the polar bear. We don’t know the significance, but it’s branding brilliance.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meanwhile, in Unilever’s Klondike division, they’re not letting this centennial pass without all kinds of dairy doings. For starters, “Cake Boss” star Buddy Valastro was commissioned to create a towering Klondike Bar cake. A sweepstakes winner will get to eat some (all if they’re fast).</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Per the Klondike Bar <a href=\"https://www.klondikebar.com/us/en/4aklondike100.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">website</a>, “To enter for a chance to win, post a photo or video on Instagram of yourself completing one of our decade-themed challenges with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/4aklondike100sweepstakes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">#4aKlondike100Sweepstakes</a> and tag @klondikebar. BONUS: one lucky winner also has a chance to win the Klondike Kard that comes with coupons and a check for free Klondike treats for one hundred years!”</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Typically retailing for $3.99 and assuming one Klondike Bar per day for a century, we’re talking almost $150,000 in Klondike Kard kredit at current valuations. Issuers, watch your backs.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In “but wait, there’s more” fashion, on July 17, look for Klondike Bar popups in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park, Navy Pier in Chicago, and along Santa Monica’s promenade.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coated ice cream block that put Pittsburgh on the map has even more in store, with a series of fun challenges from “Re-mix the WWYD jingle in the style of a barbershop quartet” to “Make a bow tie out of Klondike foil” all of which link out to Klondike’s Instagram <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/4aklondike100sweepstakes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">page</a>. We dare you.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We would be remiss not to touch on the legendary jingle and slogan, “What Would You Do for a Klondike Bar?” made famous in this 1986 TV <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAsuUMyia7o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">commercial</a>. You’d be surprised.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In 2009 a man tried to shove two K-Bars down his shorts and exit without paying. As <a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-odd-klondike-theft-030909-2009mar09-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> by the San Diego Union-Tribune, in the ensuing parking lot confrontation he offered to pay $69 for the purloined goodies to be set free, but they turned him in anyway. Talk about frosty.</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another guy went all out, filling half a duffel bag with stolen Klondikes. Apparently a known serial shoplifter in the area, he was facing seven years in prison at the time Lancaster Online <a href=\"https://lancasteronline.com/news/klondike-bar-thief-could-end-up-in-cooler/article_1b0cbc46-a826-5097-a860-ea4434c9c937.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reported</a> on the incident. In riveting detail that story reads: “the assistant manager approached him. She felt the bag, and felt it was ice cold. She could tell the ice cream was in there.\"</p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sounds like an episode of “NCIS: Ice Cream Truck,” but clearly some people would call the police for a Klondike Bar (two packages of them in that case). The takeaway: Don’t steal ice cream — especially not this weekend. Have some respect for a commercial centenarian.</p>\n",
