# Mobiconf 2019 | Elisa Coluccia "Information overload: the Era of Push Notifications"
Elisa Coluccia presenting at Mobiconf 2019 in Krakow, October 3rd-4th. Information overload: how to survive in the Era of Push Notifications As the Nobel prize Herbert Simon wrote, “a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention”. We are every day exposed to a massive amount of information that, especially now, reach us out in an increasing “pushy” way. Whether we are at work or in our home after dinner, we are constantly bombarded by notifications, emails, slack messages. To translate it in numbers, our mind can consume a maximum of 120 bit/sec and we are exposed to over 34 gigabytes of contents every day. With this presentation, we will talk about the importance of allocating our attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that takes it away. We will discuss strategies to recover the focus and taking control over the huge amount of information that we are exposed to. We will learn some techniques on how to leverage the overload of content for improving our ability of decision making.
