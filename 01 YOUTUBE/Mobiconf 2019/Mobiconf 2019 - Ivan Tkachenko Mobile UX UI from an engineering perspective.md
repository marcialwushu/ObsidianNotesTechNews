# Mobiconf 2019 | Ivan Tkachenko "Mobile UX/UI from an engineering perspective"
Ivan Tkachenko preseting at Mobiconf 2019 conference in Krakow, Poland, October 3rd-4th Mobile UX/UI from an engineering perspective Creating a beautiful and polished UI is a major undertaking, and engineers often find it difficult (and sometimes almost impossible) to follow a designer’s idea. Drawing inspiration from problem solving techniques in user experience and design, we’ll walk through some examples that illustrate how best to come up with creative solutions and solve common problems in the mobile environment. A well thought out design makes a product far more user-friendly; it’s not just about being beautiful and unique. A clear, understandable, and intuitive UX can mean the difference between a successful app and a catastrophic failure. The user should feel right at home from day one, and the app should be familiar and easy to use. However, achieving familiarity while staying unique is a hard combination, and there are a plethora of devices and form factors to consider. So, is there a way to create a beautiful, understandable, and universal design under harsh mobile constraints? We’ll dive into some best practices that have evolved over the years, several solutions from mobile platforms, and ways to get it done well.
