# Mobiconf 2019 | Andrzej Zuzak "SwiftUI – goodbye (forever), UIKit?"
The presentation by Andrzej Zuzak from Miquido, given at Mobiconf 2019 SwiftUI – goodbye (forever), UIKit? In the WWDC 2019 Apple has introduced SwiftUI – a declarative framework used to create user interfaces for all of the Apple platforms, and by doing so it’s blown our minds. In this session we’ll try to answer some simple questions: can UIKit be dumped already? Should we completely alter our perception of the programming UIs on iOS? Does this mean that all of our applications should be re-implemented? We’ll find the satisfiable answers – and learn the basics of SwiftUI – by the end of this talk.
