# Mobiconf 2019 | Piotr Ślesarew "Bottom navigation headache"
Piotr Ślesarew presenting at Mobiconf 2019 conference in Krakow, October 3rd-4th. Bottom navigation headache Most modern Android applications use a single Activity strategy as a core of architecture. Building such a solution can be really difficult in terms of clean and bulletproof navigation. What type of component should be used to represent individual screen? How to define eye-candy animations to provide the best look and feel for the user? Support for deep links? Saving states and sending data between screens? All of those things can give a huge headache, and that is why I would like to present my journey from navigation madness to navigation happiness. Live coding included!
