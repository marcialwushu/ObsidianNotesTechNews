# Cybertopia - Dreams of Silicon Valley - Docu - 2015
What is the vision of cyber-utopists in Silicon Valley? They are responsible for a revolution that shapes our lives on all levels.This is a portrait of Cybertopia. We read the gospel according to Steve Jobs, download the latest apps and are in awe of Google. This revolution is shaped by new programmers, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley. They have the knowledge, networks and money. Perhaps the idea that Silicon Valley wants to be separated from the United States, is a prelude to what awaits us. Originally broadcasted by VPRO in 2015.
